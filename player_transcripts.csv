Olli Juolevi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTdZL494Oj8,"how crazy this time been for you after
coming off the Memorial Cup and the
season you guys had come here get ready
for the draft does it just seem like
your head spinning oh yeah of course I'm
specific and you're playing like
playoffs mm copy and think our craft as
much antenna when you come here now and
you have to talk about craft rankings
and all those things with the team son
like so it's it's little bit different I
think it's better like oh like those
nine dozen fans every night pretty much
and like great team and like of course
like pretty I'm blue player front I
think my hockey IQ and how smart I am
either and like I think it's pretty hard
to teach that thing and I can always go
like to work on your dream and get more
muscle sort of practice my shooting or
somewhere table it's hard to teach 23
yes nice and like you never know about
those it's like sometimes you're like so
mad after those and summers are so happy
but 15 who you click where it came from
at my crafting and like actually like
Jen taste when I like try to you like
what's going over like you're mad or
some like test so it's pretty exciting
yeah it's like I like first day 19 some
like seven in a row so it's you have to
like concentrate a lot and special
winning this is my first language and
it's like you're pretty hard after lost
interest and just when I go sleep yeah I
think it's like a good team I like but
like I don't think you to a Justine
unlike if you're just good there you got
show we were best I'm like just just do
best there and like yeah everything went
well we weren't the championship and I
really so it's pivots perfect tournament
and you're from hell thank you
yeah I'm from Helsinki so it's like 10
minutes
away from my home so it's very nice was
it was like winning gold in yogurt arena
yeah it was of course like might redeem
us all this when I was young that go
play like games with yogurt the protein
they were like now I want like to earn
championship tears I was it's pretty
great
yeah I like humbly and hope from Anaheim
and like I think we have some same
things they're like the Teva games there
but also like their offensive upside and
we can play a particular power play and
I like all situation on big minutes oh
yeah yeah of course like all the
Europeans they want to be like you know
sir prayers and like if you just watch
those like this aircraft or how many
pairs is so traffic from OHL and things
like dozen like especially like London
London's great place and probably the
best place to play junior hockey so it
was just great feeling that table made
there and like I was more than excited
to come there yeah of course it detects
while especially like language things
and like having pretty low with that
things and like but yeah at first first
month is pretty pretty hard all this but
like other great team like everybody was
friendly Teeter and so it was it was
great yeah I've spent a lot of time as
Victor meta actually he was driving me
after practice and beside I have to
truck my tribal glasses so yeah he was
so much like with me pretty much and
also like Max Jones and those young guys
I was a prima smile all the time with
those guys
oh man Kupfer shape just like it's
pretty much like a ninety game nine
months or almost 10 months which sunk
one team and just for one goal and it
all comes down for overtime one game
last game and like it's it's pretty
exciting the Knights had that circle
that you guys would do before games and
warm-ups where guys like dancer and tell
stories what did you do when you were in
the middle
I actually I've ever dancing with me
tomorrow because we had Saint birthday
so we have birthday dance with Peter huh
you expect me the first defenseman
drafted yeah I'm I'm first defenseman at
least Jota so nice for like yeah when
you see out sir just wear out starring
boats and everything so it looks good
and like of course all this like North
German cities are different and Helsinki
but like it's just I think it's great
city and I saw so the basketball court
there so it's like sports city also"
Tyson Jost,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvX2IFou3R0,"the decision to stay and play in the BC
Hockey League do you get a chance to
look back over the last couple of years
and have no regrets knowing where you're
headed this fall and and with how much
you've developed the last 48 months I
guess yeah no regrets at all I think you
nail on the head I mean I was so happy
with my decision to go to the bchl and
pursue the NCAA route I mean I think
that's the one route that really stands
out for me is just I thought I developed
so much as a player in a person and I
think that was huge for me that's
something that's really big in the NHL
now is development and I mean all the
players need it so I'm so happy with my
decision and I mean Penton was
unbelievable to me these past two years
and now I get to pursue North Dakota
here and hopefully try and make it a
back toback National Championship so I'm
really excited you look back uh to the
history of the league Kyle turus Tyler
boak they had a heck of a final year
going head-to-head and scoring
championship and all the history is
there and the pedigree is there with
that League yeah I mean it's pretty
special I mean you look at players in
Penton 2o like Duncan Keith was there
for a little bit Bo Bennett was there so
Joe Hanson was there for a little bit
too so I mean there those are big time
names I really stand not so I mean it's
not like the bchl is a lower league or
anything like that there's a lot of star
NHL players that played in that league
and I mean it's it's a special League to
be a part of and like I said before I'm
really happy with the road I Choose You
More Than doubled your point total from
your first year to your second year what
was the key in that regard I think a
really big reason was just the team I
had around me I mean our first year in
Penton we went all the way to the
National Championship lost in the
semi-final game and we had just such a
solid four-line team I mean we played a
really kind of defensive style of game
and we shut teams out and then this year
I mean we were really uh really high
strong offensive team we had a lot of
high high players like Dante obviously
was a guy in the back end that was
really good at moving the pck and was
really a great offensive Dem man and
then guys like Scott Conway and Nick
Jones I mean those were some guys that
really s outes me and those guys also
came back from college too so I think
that helps we had a really offensive
team and I think a lot of My Success was
credited credited to my teammates too
what uh do you think about when you look
back on the opportunity to wear the CN
pen tickton in for Canada as well and
route to a gold medal uh how much of an
honor was that for you looking back on
it huge I mean I know it may sound
cliche but it's something I've honestly
dreamed about for a while was wearing a
sea for Team Canada and holding a trophy
up wearing that logo on your chest I
think that's something that's pretty
special and I mean to do that it was it
was something that I'll remember for a
while and I mean the world junior a
challenge there where we won in Colberg
I mean that was such a special feeling
we were kind of looked upon as The
Underdogs and to prove everybody wrong
it was it was pretty special and we had
such a great group of guys so I mean to
be a leader on all those teams it's
something that's very humbling what uh
do you take from your meeting with the
Maple Leafs as you meet with other teams
as well uh what was it like in there it
was cool I mean you look at the the
Leafs are such a prestigious team and
they're such a big hockey City so I mean
it was special meeting with them and
meeting all those bigname guys it was
pretty cool and it's something that I'll
remember and like I said it's just such
an awesome experience it's pretty
surreal to look back and like when I was
a little kid two years old playing in
the drive playing hockey I never really
dreamt that uh all this could happen so
I'm really excited about it and I'm
looking forward to Friday"
Michael McLeod,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro15gFjuueI,"mikee you're really filling out I guess
that's been the biggest uh uh plus right
is that you're physically getting ready
for this next step right yeah put on uh
you know close to 10 lbs now since end
the season well so I'm almost you know
200 lb so I'm feeling good about my
weight and uh I'm still feeling fast
what has this week been like to be
around the other players and just
develop your your game yeah it's cool
seeing the the new prospects from this
year's draft and you know guys you uh
you met last year in Camp and kind of
build a relationship from last year and
you know just a fun week overall you
have a obviously a very good opportunity
to make this team what what's your goal
what do you want to improve yeah just uh
you know put on the weight and you know
I just need to you know and the what
their uh coach are saying you know work
hard every shift uh it's a battle every
shift and you know defense is a big part
of uh you know playing NHL so I got to
you know be good at that has uh miles
taken you under his wing I've been uh
ring with Miles I know from last year
and uh yeah a little bit what do you
think of Nico and just uh now your
advice to this year's first round yeah
he's obviously unal player and went
first overall so can't really give him
much advice he's uh I think he'll be
fine by his own and finally uh for you
um just getting a taste of it last year
coming back to this Camp you feel a
little bit more comfortable yeah
definitely uh yeah being here last year
pretty much the same thing and uh you
know it's a competition every day and
out here was a three on three compe
competition uh you know I won it last
year but uh came in third this year so
you know it's not uh the best feeling"
Max Jones,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBBSAUrtMJA,"talk about that you know that third
period and why you don't to be able to
do there ah obviously was a close one so
we are a voice are really positive on
the bench so we knew we had to do
something to get back in it I want to be
tied the game makes to help of some
teammates you know obviously we are all
chipping in to you know tie the game up
and then right at the end there McKenna
said a great shot took the lead there so
I was a huge release for boys this year
end up at the one day I mean such a
back-and-forth day was a kind of what
you expected pretty open look yeah I'm
obviously top prospects in America right
so I didn't to be at the top of their
game here is done they obviously split
the team's really evenly and that was
really close game I'm surprised everyone
you know we put more effort than I guess
what where did it like at the start of
the game and I mean weird energy cuz you
guys are certain point wait for like you
settled into the game yeah I guess you
know more of different hours I usually
I'd listen to music or game so kind of
cold calls me down and it kind of
loosens me up you know gets married for
the game and I know our I just the
jitters were there obviously everyone's
got the jitters know what to expect
great the game a lot of players have
been playing there so ignite but you
know I think I adapted really well so I
got my first shift or worse off that we
got all season the Prescotts I guess we
did check to show them what you can do
but was it mean to you know gonna put a
couple of score sheet today in this game
ah it's good you know obviously I wanted
to have that opportunity Philip two
teammates you know my linemates else
playing with logan browning a willing
here up great hockey players you know
obviously I couldn't put the puck in the
net without them so i gotta link them
put more the credit on that girl who
somebody else on your team in a person
today ah you know Charlie McEvoy did you
know Keller bellows you know those guys
pretty much everyone we know obviously I
don't played a great game top prospects
for a reasonably nice you talking about
sharing the ice with so many of your
former teammates and friends ah it's
great experience obviously a played with
those guys last year so it's good to you
know get in touch with them again and
play with them and play against some of
them so it's kind of like a practice out
there playing against some of those guys
again
it was really fun you know a lot of
jokes going around and a lot of
competitiveness also he's talked about
heading in New Yorkers OHL season and
we're looking forward to I'm excited
obviously it's a pro schedule so I'm
looking forward to that obviously the
league's unbelievable love the OHL it's
been watching it for years so I'm really
excited to see what happens you talk

good time it's fun we're just having fun
out there and a tough loss yesterday so

in the game like that then after what
happened yesterday yeah I mean it was
tough to know you want to sit in your
room feel sad but you still got a game
and wonder what a medal
was there something about today that
maybe the ice opened up for you a little
bit obviously weren't able to do as much
of that earlier on the term I guess what
was it about today where things kind of
clicked for you obviously this game

part of this tournament you know like I
played a jacket for I had a lot of

Brett Howden,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doDWh20ZCtw,"hi i'm speaking with new york rangers
forward brett howden
brett how's it been getting back into
new york and getting back with your
teammates
uh it's been good um it's fun to see all
the guys again
obviously in a different nature this
time but uh
we're all uh we're all excited to be
back um you know we're excited to be
back playing and
excited to get players so
you know over the break you guys were
heading into the the paws
one of the hottest teams the nhl coming
back to the
to the rangers do you guys still feel
like you have that momentum that you had
heading into the pause
and you're going to use that in the
series with carolina
yeah for sure i think obviously the way
we ended the season is how we want to
play
um the way we were playing was uh you
know at the top of our game throughout
the whole year
um you know really confident in our game
and we're confident in each other and
i think that's huge when you can find
confidence in each other every every
night
um obviously goes a long way but um you
know we all we all are feeling really
good we're glad to be back in it
well you've played 136 games now in the
nhl um
you're in your second full season where
did you feel like you
really started to get your confidence at
the nhl level
um i think it just comes over time for
sure
um obviously there's lots of ups and
downs during the season but
i think confidence um just comes from
work ethic
you know the harder the work um the more
you earn and
i just felt like i've been trying to
work my hearts you know
while i've been here and on the ice
obviously it's
it's a big step up from you know when i
came up from junior
so ever since then i've been just uh you
know trying to trying to play my game
and trying to work hard and try and gain
confidence off of that
well speaking of working hard uh did you
head back to oak bank back home to
manitoba
were you able to get on the ice or get
in the gym what was your your pause how
did it look and what'd you get up to
yeah uh so when i got back um obviously
everything was shut down for everybody
throughout the world for the first
little bit um
and then uh i was actually lucky uh my
brother uh has a gym in his house so
we were able to train together um while
we couldn't go to the gym
um and then uh eventually the gym opened
up
and sorted the rink so i was able to
skate and work out
um pretty quick honestly after i got
back i was skating for a little while
before i came back here to new york so
it was nice to
you know kind of feel the ice and kind
of get back into it before we started
here
well during that break you've had a
tremendous start to your career
not just in your juniors but also now to
the nhl did you sit down and just
think about you know some of the best
memories you've had and is there a
memory
so far that sticks out to you as your
your favorite hockey memory
um i think winning world juniors for
sure
um that was obviously very special
winning with your country obviously a
tournament that everybody watches
growing up around christmas time so
being able to win that with that group
of guys that we had that was probably
the best hockey memory i have yeah that
was a
it was a great tournament it was an
awesome one to watch
so getting back to the nhl here what's
it been like
getting back on the ice with your team
um are you guys
starting fresh over like this is
training camp all over again are you
picking up right where you left off
uh is there any any forgetting the
systems or is everybody back on page
yeah well i mean like i said it's it's a
little different this time around for a
training camp
um just coming back in you know some
guys were in places where they could
skate some guys were in places where
they couldn't just depended on where you
were
obviously that's to no one's fault um so
it's a little bit different this time
around but
um the first little bit obviously um
is just more trying to get back into it
and everybody came back a little bit
early before
camp started so they could feel the ice
um but once we
you know once we actually started
training camp we hit the ground running
and
and we've been we've been going uh
really good here the last couple weeks
and
every day we've been feeling better and
better and you know working on our
systems and things like that but
ultimately just trying to get back into
battle mode and geared up
well you're heading to toronto on sunday
i've asked a few guys already
what do you bring into the bubble to
keep you entertained during the time
off uh oh a few of us
um are playing some uh you know ps4 xbox
stuff like that
uh to you know buy some time right now i
got a couple books that i got as well
uh to help pass the time um there's a
couple shows
on netflix that i was watching when i
was back home in canada
uh that i can't watch here because it's
not on the american foot so i'm sure
that up again yeah i guess i guess
that's really it
now you're not bringing the mini sticks
out playing the hallways
well brett thanks for taking time today
i wish you all the best and you're
running to the cup here and uh good luck
awesome thank you very much
you"
Luke Kunin,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qWDvgxolqU,"Jillian mayen here for btn.com today we
are joined by Luke cunnin the captain of
the Wisconsin hockey team Luke this is a
pretty special occasion because you are
not only a big star on Wisconsin's team
but you were also captain of the for the
USA team for World Junior Championships
and coming off of a huge win so let's
just start by can you describe what that
was like that moment when you beat
canada yeah I was I was pretty surreal
you know we had a great group of guys in
that locker room and you know we were
real close bunch and you know come out
on top there was no better feeling so
just a great experience that I've had my
life so far and you know it was just it
was a great time what was it like
playing in the World Junior
Championships and representing Team USA
and also being a captain for Team USA
yeah it was you know something I dreamed
about as a kid you know to play for the
u.s. in the world juniors and you know
obviously it was so so special to be the
captain of that team you know hopefully
that team do a gold medal and you know
just really words can't describe it just
so much fun and so glad i got the
opportunity talk about that moment when
you actually received the gold medal and
it was a pretty exciting game against
canada what was that moment like when it
finally clicked it oh my gosh we just
won this yeah you know being in a
shootout two nights in a row like that I
was pretty nerve-wracking but you know
we had the guys in our squad to get it
done and you know when Troy scored that
that shootout goal we were pretty
confident that parse you know he'd
stopped that that next shooter and you
know we were gonna be gold medal you
know gold medal champions and you know
that's that's how it worked out and you
know I wouldn't had it any other way
what was it like when you actually
received that metal because you actually
got to take the trophy as the captain
right yeah you know pretty special uh
you know a lot of goosebumps lifting
that trophy above my head and just being
able to share with those guys you know
we work so hard and you know we were so
close like I said just so special to be
able to share with them after
how hard we worked and you know hostile
crowd like we were in Canada there and
it was just you know made it all the
better and was just so special what is
it like for you to represent not only
with the team USA but also Wisconsin as
you're playing for Team USA yeah I was
awesome you know Wisconsin has had a lot
of guys you know in the world juniors
and be successful in the world junior so
I just wanted to you know keep the keep
the train going and just help do
whatever I could help the team be
successful and you know we were
successful so you know a great track
record of you know Wisconsin players
being in that tournament and doing good
things and I just wanted to keep doing
that can you describe the difference
between playing in the big ten and
playing for Wisconsin and playing for
Team USA and playing in a competition
like that yeah i think you know playing
here wisconsin college hockey you know
there's older guys it's a little more
physical more of a grindy game and then
you go you know playing against the best
players in the world at this age group a
lot more skill I think and you know a
lot more high scoring I feel like just
you know just the way the games played I
thinks a little bit different and it
kind of got a strategize a little bit
differently but you know I definitely
think me playing here Wisconsin helped
me be successful in you know
international stage how do you find a
way to balance academics with not only
being an athlete which we talked a lot
of athletes and ask them about balancing
academics and their practice schedule
and their game schedules but you also
have this added element of playing in
the world junior championship so how do
you find time for it all I think time
management is huge you know you got to
stay on top of your work and get things
done on time and you know I was
fortunate enough to have a lot of help
here and I got my stuff done before I
left so it didn't have to think about it
when I was gone at the tournament I
could just focus on hockey you have a
pretty famous coach Tony Granato and
what is it like playing for him and
knowing what his history is with the
game yeah it's been unbelievable uh you
know I'm so lucky to have him you know
with you know Donny and I as coaches
here I've learned so much already and
you know I know I'm only gonna learn
more and more from them every day and
just very fortunate to have the coaches
that we have here because you know they
have they've been at the highest levels
and you know that's where I want to be
so just you know being a sponge soaking
it all in and it's been great I saw a
quote from one of your coaches saying
that you're you're just a workhorse
that's kind of what your staple is in
hockey and I even saw a quote comparing
you to JJ Watt who plays football but
still that's a pretty good comparison
how do you describe the way that you
approach hockey and your practice
mentality yeah you know I just want to
be successful in whatever it is I'm
doing in life and you know your work
ethic I feel like is one thing that you
can control there's a lot of things you
can't so you know if you're the
hardest-working guy and most competitive
guy think good things will follow so I
just always try to bring those elements
to my game I know a lot of athletes have
superstitions or the routines that they
have to do before every game do you have
any bizarre superstitions or anything
like that that you have to have before
each game I don't know if there's
anything too crazy I like staying on my
you know my schedule I get dressed you
know put my gear on a certain way take
my stick a certain way little things
like that but nothing nothing too
bizarre that that needs to be shared so
when you say put your gear on a certain
way I've talked to football players and
soccer players who are like I have to
put my right sock on before my left sock
I have to tie my left shoe before my
right shoe it's not what you're talking
about something like that like a pattern
Yeah Yeah right right shin guard on
before laughs left skate on before right
tidal off skate before before the right
there's there's a bunch of them so that
it's pretty detailed I mean it seems to
work for you you're very successful so I
would say that it may seem a little
strange to other people but it's working
for you right yeah it's working so I'm
not gonna change anything right
out all right you are also a captain of
this Wisconsin hockey team but you're
just a sophomore so what is it like
being you know on the younger side of
this team but also being a leader on the
team yeah it's it's been awesome very
honored to be selected you don't captain
here and you know we have a lot of great
leaders in that locker room and you know
guys like grab a seat Cameron Hughes you
know Corbin McGuire upperclassmen who
who you know I count on a lot and you
know we just kind of feed off each other
and I think that's why we've we've been
doing well so far you know we just got
to keep keep the things going that we're
doing um you know things have been
things have been progressing in the
right way and we just want to keep that
going do you have an outlook for the
rest of the season what kind of goals
have you guys set for the team yeah you
know we're just taking it day by day we
came by weekend and you know we just
don't want to focus on our next game our
next opponent to be ready for that you
know just keep kidding wins and you know
we want to win a big ten championship
and you know make the tournament make a
run so you know we're
there's in that locker room and you know
losing doesn't sit well with us so you
know that's what we're trying to do you
talked about the history of former
Badgers playing for Team USA and also
your former coaches is an alum do you
have a specific badger that you look up
to you know there's a lot of guys I
think you know Podolski's one you know
he's doing great things in the NHL now
he's played you know for the US and you
know I just love his all-around game and
what he brings to the table so he's one
guy that I like to watch what personal
goals do you have for yourself this
season you've accomplished so much
already but do you have benchmarks or
goals that you set for yourself
throughout the season that you would
like to hit yeah for sure um you know
one of my goals just when a Big Ten
championship and you know a national
championship but you know that's what
we're that's what we're trying to do
here and I think we're you know we're on
the right track alright Luke thank you
so much for joining us and best of luck
with the rest of the season and
congratulations on that gold medal yeah
thanks a lot thanks for having me"
Alexander Nylander,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGYMjwYC8FU,"power-play goal I darling look like you
put it right you must take me through
yeah I mean I got a good possum dolly
and then obviously I'm just thinking
shoot there and fortunately I went in
this is a new test for your going up
against their top line once again how do
you think you did personally I think we
did well we had we had a lot of chances
but obviously we we gotta capitalize on
our chance let's play a little bit more
simple and getting more parts than that
it was defensively I mean offensively
you score four on the road that probably
should be enough to win but it seemed
like defensively especially in the
second period you guys just weren't
there as a team yeah I mean obviously
they were we are we have made a couple
mistakes and they capitalize them on
them so we just got to clean up those
stuff in the next game coming up here
and obviously playing a little more
simple DS on getting the first pass and
touching parts first in the rezone
I mean it's getting better and better I
shot these games I played and
fortunately play with really good good
line mates as well and I'm just trying
to keep keep working hard and play my
game playing simple getting pucks than
that did it just feels like they never
took the foot off the gas because you
guys came close a couple times you've
been tied at at 3-3 they just feel like
they can't keep kept coming yeah I mean
we were good I was good enough that we
came back there and just made a couple
mistakes like I said I capitalized on
what you needed any cleanup and B no
problem just working on that in practice
and stuff like that get better for the
next game thank you"
Kieffer Bellows,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lktjbb768U,"[Music]
yeah my decision by the NTP came after
my first year playing juniors and suit
balls like trying to team my under 18
year and you know the guys really
brought me and made me feel like I was
one of the team and you know didn't make
me feel like I was a new guy I think
just the Brotherhood that comes from
playing from the
the relationship you build your team and
also the younger guys being so close
with them all the time and you know
especially happier roommate help with JT
green like nobody felt a good
Brotherhood there and meant the world to
me you know putting on a jersey that
says USA every single day going
international tournaments representing
your country is really something special
or really it's home and you know
something we always want to do your
whole entire life and as soon as you
throw meters the first time it really
means a lot
I'd say probably Switzerland trip it was
pretty good scored is there and I think
that was probably my favorite just
because you know we had a lot of fun
notes our first international tournament
of the under-18 here and just you know
we had a lot of fun with other teams as
well you know playing soccer was Sweden
you know before the tournament started
and also even climbing up I'm afraid of
heights so we climb about and that was
pretty scary for me and foxy I remember
us kind of freaking out on that mountain
I think that GP prepared me for college
hockey on the ice just with the you know
the way they want you to ensure and you
don't play the game in the right
professional matter and then off the ice
as well you know they they put a lot of
the you could say the pressure on you to
become a good adult and a good person
and to respect others and you know
really a big thing in college and you're
on your own
[Music]"
German Rubtsov,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZXKAAd-znE,"it's game and the starter game and
getting all those shots in the beginning
it was it felt good to have that done
which time do you think you'll need in
the AHL before you feel comfortable you
could be an NHL goalie or are you do you
feel like you're ready right now I like
the game over here it's like it wanted
more more shots and more direct to the
Nets I feel more like this is better for
me that's that's what I'm feeling so I'm
feeling feeling well prepared from this
summer and it's been going good during
the prices in this game too so we're
looking forward to the future we usually
ask skaters if it's a big adjustment the
ice size because they have to skate more
or less or whatever is there an
adjustment for you with the angles
you're playing against yeah I mean I
would say Moe the biggest change is the
more parks come to none at all time and
it's so much faster like going from one
side to the other most of the times in
Sweden it's like most of the times the
puck end up in the corners that's not
happening here pretty much that's I
would say it's the biggest change to
always stay ready on the whole
situations
do you see that yeah think so too like
this more like uncontrollable in
situations so you have to stay stay
really all the time and not every chance
is perfect so you have to be on edge all
the time okay first you know real game
in a while you know you obviously have
summer scrimmages and stuff but I was
kind of the first like true game and
yeah I'm glad I got that game under my
with my legs under me yeah I think we
had a good week of practice and I think
we complement each other well so I
wasn't really surprised that we're gonna
have chemistry is just a matter of
executing elevated order to get real
camps toward excited yeah
I got a head start here with rookie camp
and now that that's over yet like he
said I'm really excited for Ming camp
what did you see on the the goal you set
up for recovering in the first yeah I
mean I think we had agreed so you
couldn't say Joel made a nice play and
then they had a turnover in the neutral
zone and we kind of quick up quick opt
on them and Riley dropped it's me and at
first I was going to talk then happeh
them out of the corner of my eye saw the
lake I come in so I kind of just pulled
up and you know a bit of a risky pass
but it works oh yeah that was actually
uh Joel actually gave me that move right
before I went so I took his advice and I
think it was they're just there's you
know a couple inches
it's not quite up to you but when do you
start in the main camp do you think
you'll stay at center they might try it
the way I don't know maybe they gave you
a heads up beforehand no I haven't heard
anything
kind of just gonna be prepared for
whatever happens and you know a bit of
an adjustment if I had been moved to win
but definitely ready to face that
challenge if it's uh if it comes do you
feel like you're a copper level in the
game this year was more than your game
last year yeah definitely I think every
year you probably get a little bit more
confident and yeah and in third years so
felt a little bit more comfortable just
with the you know preparation for the
game and you know just the pace of the
game and that kind of thing so yeah
definitely comfortable would you think
of Felix's performance especially in
first degree yeah he played and he was
kind of a backbone there so you know if
it wasn't for him they probably could
had a couple goals not for his period so
yeah sure per bushel krasnogorovka cable
children was that all superior I knew
changeup in your mouth no child but on
the build world we already put you in
commercial we grow now the talk about
later provided a long time was exciting
and a little bit of everything and I was
a little bit not feeling himself at the
beginning and after the first goal
everything came back with a super Afra
generate
Russian strain you support it you grab
billeted a lot and the training anything
is easier everything has come more
natural on the on the game it's a little
bit more harder
are you okay the not see me chesty
Roboto any girl would sell in Yahoo
shots per minute he didn't play the
whole year so it was working on every
aspects of the game had to get to work
on pretty much everything beginning a
camp about wanting to push into the
offenses earn more now were you
satisfied with how you did that in
tonight's game no stop
hmm pooch 8 skinny abortion natural
breast height be white
Ypres Bronto shinzaburo Raghava natural
food regrettin yes party working he got
the push and get two more shots was two
more shots coming more goals but he
don't forget about defensive zone either
the fluids of the day off tomorrow and
we're gonna rock and roll yeah I thought
I played pretty well I think as a line
you know we played really well I'm a
couple bad turnovers here and there but
overall I thought we played pretty well
and um you know we gave her favor cells
a chance to win but the end of the day
talky and kind of happens all the way
your game is generated off of getting in
the forecheck creating pressure in ours
I probably say like majority held the
offense I think just that's kind of you
know the best part my game is just being
able to turn over parks and create plays
that way so um then I thought I did that
pretty well tonight and yeah I just
gotta keep movin forward you can't that
you really wanted to work on your
strengths and I feel like this is the
first opportunity that you really had to
kind of explore that and see what you
could do with it how do you
I think you've performed in that way
yeah I thought you know we we held on to
a lot of pucks in there third D zone and
so um yeah I thought I'd played pretty
well as far as you know protecting the
puck and making place so yeah I'm pretty
happy in that aspect but you know
there's always room for improvement as
you prepare to join camp yeah I think
right now I just got a recover and I get
ready for me in camp it's gonna be
pretty similar it's probably even harder
than you know rookie camp so ha there's
gonna be some really good players at
camp so I got to be you know ready to go
and yeah should I get my body ready um
yeah I mean just like I said before I'm
just got to be able to show that I can
handle an 82-game season and you know
play at the NHL level physically so i
think if i can prove that i think you
know my play is yeah i can mesh well and
top to bottom in a lineup so I think
yeah I think I just got a show that I'm
physically ready probably how much were
they watching me how much will that
carry over in the main camp for you as
cerebral kind of guy like that or do you
think you'll be able to put it behind
you pretty quick yeah I think um yeah
I'm not gonna worry about it too much I
think right now I just got to focus on
you know recovering from this game it
was kind of was really hot out there I
know guys sweat a lot out there so who
you gotta you know get hydrate and stuff
like that and yeah I'm just focusing on
main camp now the game's over so you
know definitely reflect and see what I
can do better but at the end of the day
I just gotta get ready for main camp
guys on all fours - yeah I think um you
know it's still us today yeah if it's a
hot day outside um then we got so drink
it was really foggy in here so but at
the end of the day you know they have to
plan the ice - so um yeah I mean we
could have been better tonight but um
yeah sometimes the bounces just don't go
your way especially at the end of the
game that there's two chances in
overtime but it just kind of feel like
whatever you were doing just wasn't
going into that for you yeah I mean I
think I had a couple chances where I you
know should have went in here but not
but um yeah like I said it's just kind
of how hockey goes sometimes so yeah
well Duff I'd do some video
go over what I can do better but yeah
she's gonna put it behind me about this
summer about just wanting to come into
this camp prepared and that had a lot to
do with you training in Philly this
summer can you speak a little bit how
prepared you feel and and I mean this
I'm sure a lot of excitement heading
into your first NHL camp but yeah you've
tried to do your best to put yourself in
a position to be successful here yeah I
think um you know the biggest thing for
staying here in the summer was just
getting as comfortable as possible you
know a lot of guys are much older than
me at the camp I'm only 19 so I think
just staying here all summer you know
meeting a lot of the staff and stuff
like that meeting the guys that come in
it's really helped me just feel a lot
more comfortable you know obviously my
first camp I'm gonna be pretty nervous
but you know I can try and decrease that
a little bit by just you know being here
all summer and yeah I'm ready to go yeah
I think just my style of play I think I
can play and you know anywhere in a
lineup whether it is you know first line
or fourth line I think I can help a team
so I think that's probably my biggest
strength as a player just being able to
play different roles peak a power play
stuff like that so you know if I can
show that during camp and you know the
staff likes it and hopefully that gives
me the best shot he played really well
so it I think especially in the first
period we can put them in some tough
situations and you came out some big
saves
at this level yeah it's that's for
somebody else make that decision so but
you know we obviously goaltending depth
is important and you know seelix played
a game last year you've had a pretty
good showing tonight so you know he's
he's on the right path it's doesn't do
anybody any good not to to play so
that's the especially goaltending shots
of shots and then sometimes you know
shots from East Coast Lee can be more of
a challenge and can make you a better
goaltender yeah he's a talented player
you know yeah he's gonna kill penalties
uh if he's here he's killing felony as
far as he's playing on the power play
you know he makes the players around
them better
like always every time they were on the
ice they were on the attack and it was a
little bit more of a struggle for the
other ones I think some something a
little bit was the transition coming out
of our zone you know sometimes you're
you know it's it's this big difference
between you know being on the ice with a
guy like Phil Myers a lot of his shifts
matched up with those guys so that helps
but obviously all three of those guys
that I could skate they have skill they
can protect the puck well you know
there's an element of speed there so a
lot a lot of things that makes the the
entries a lot easy for them he has value
in that and that's the biggest thing you
can talk about being first on the
forecheck but he wants to do it he wants
to get in there and it means something
for him and he has a big impact on that
line the Flyers yeah I think the biggest
thing is just getting acclimated to
bigger bodies there's the speed of the
game his skill is as good as any player
that we've had here and you know having
been on the Flyers bench last year he's
certainly right up there in the top
grouping of players as far as skill goes
so his adjustment to the pace of playing
the size of the players that for me is
gonna be the biggest thing
he's an NHL player to me he played like
it
he's there's no no panic you know he's
he's done a great job of preparing
himself in the last two years to be an
NHL player and now we just gotta have a
good camp in everything she'd fall in
the place where I thought her opieop did
a lot of good things I'm just going
through the lines here max she just goes
did some things that I thought I liked
in the offensive zone you know one of
the guys that I thought kind of stood
out maybe less heralded than the rest of
them was Gilad you know it seemed like
every time he was on the ice good things
happen why I played I thought he played
well when I looked at the D so I mean
this obviously there's a lot of things
that there's a lot of mistakes in a game
like that and you know you're you're
talking to the team in between periods
about things that you've talked about
all week and you know obviously that
they're not gonna remember everything
there's a isn't you know maybe an
element of coaching that they might not
get from a correction standpoint when
they're in junior you know for those
guys that are first-year players and
probably a little more detailed and
stuff that they're accustomed to and you
know if times their heads gonna spin and
sometimes just survival so I you know I
like the effort you know biggest thing
was park management that probably could
have been better with me the game Audis
getting ready to do a physical nature of
the game at this level but just the
number of games as well I'm curious in
what you see from that and in this game
and how that's translated and if during
the course of the training camp you can
use your body better well I think as far
as body improvement I guess he's gained
weight so that's gonna make him stronger
and it's gonna make it more effective
when it comes to protecting the puck
absorbing a hit making a hit so I think
you know those those things are
important they're an important for every
player but if you're you can do that in
college and you can do that in junior
hockey and if you move up to the NHL it
becomes a little bit harder if you light
so that's something that's gonna be
important
whatever he weighs now I'm sure you're
from now probably you know another 10
pounds or eight pounds and as he goes on
through his career he'll get to a point
where he's at the right weight for him
to be able to tolerate NHL season
horses a quick game to put together like
you said I'm not sure how much you know
they get from from such a quick being
here
from a coaching standpoint what are the
things that you're really hoping they
take away from this experience and this
hopefully they I think the biggest thing
is just identifying time and space is
gonna be a little bit different than
what they're accustomed to first year
players my I felt like the older players
it was an easier task for them and they
made fewer turnovers mistakes like that
but the you know that that to me is the
the biggest challenge just identifying
you know not everything that you did in
junior and college is gonna work and
you've got to figure that out will
obviously help them in that area but
when they're in the heat of the battle
there are things that they've got to
figure out
you"

Lucas Johansen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlsaxxGSLOs,"so how was day one it's good it was
pretty tough they work just pretty good
but you know it's it's important time
now to get ready for the season so when
one any other way doesn't feel like just
another practice or it's day one always
a little different a little more energy
yeah me everybody wants to set a good
first impression so maybe you know you I
don't wanna say you give a little extra
when there would be a do in a way in
terms of like maybe staying on after
extra and trying to show that you know
you want to be here and you want to have
a role here so I think most guys are in
the same boat when it comes to that what
do they tell you sending you down they
wanted me to get used to the program
they wanted me to to learn some things
and you know we went over what I should
be getting better at and you know I
think it's it's it's about your attitude
when you get sent down obviously I'm not
you know you're not excited about it but
you know in a way you got to find a way
to to get up and and you know you can't
waste a week where you're down and you
know so I think it's important to have a
good attitude I have a good attitude
about and I'm just going to do what they
ask
that's good I mean I didn't play I
it was obviously nice to learn their
systems and stuff and just see how they
operate and get a little sense of the
pro life I think you know that's what I
want us here to get to get prepared dark
to get us prepared for for the future so
yeah it took as much as I could from
well one thing we did say in the meeting
was the three and threes are pretty
tough and that's some you know I have
done in the in the Junior League but it
looks like it's on a new level here so
I'm looking forward to seeing how it is
I'll probably have a better answer for
you after a few games I don't know how
much talking about how crazy
the division was set up last year and
how came down to the wire teams that
were the best teams in the conference
didn't make the playoffs what are you
expecting from such a tough division
every single game really matters for you
guys
especially in Division ya know that I
mean that's kind of exciting you don't
want it to be you know uneven you want
you want everybody to be competitive and
I think you know that helps everybody
get prepared for their ultimate goal to
play in the NHL it's obviously both
leagues are very competitive so yeah
it's exciting when you say they set you
down and told you what they want you to
work on specifically that end of things
yeah they want me to find my offensive
game at a pro level they want to be able
to you know have me contribute from the
back end and be a factor offensively
they want me to just pretty much all get
used to a pro game get get used to what
I've always done
but just you know want a little faster
little you know bigger guys and so forth
if you have to explain to Bears fans
what your game is kind of based around
how I'd say I'm a fish and skater who
can join or lead to Rush positionally
sound you know Epoque move and
defenseman that can I can operate from
the blue line and make plays"
Sam Steel,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3YP3h3vvzI,"go pats go very mobile is a proud
supporter of your team bones you want
service you deserve it's as easy as one
two or three Perry mobile your sasktel
authorized dealer Tim I imagine it's
still a little bitter after that loss
but is there some serious optimism for
this team going forward as you look
ahead to your your 18 year old soon oh I
think you know like you said it's not
you know not the way we wanted to go out
but you know I thought it was a really
good series we played a pretty good game
seven I thought it could have went
either way and you know we just came out
on the wrong side of it but going
forward I think it's you know we have a
lot of young players and I think we're
gonna be you know just as strong or even
stronger next year youyou watched a
pretty special read last year with with
the injury but what was it like to be a
part of this one and another one for a
second straight year to go as far as
this oh yeah it was tough to watch it
last year but being able to you know I
guess I learned from watching it too but
this year being a part of it too is it
was special and you know just how
everybody comes together it's a pretty
cool experience if you had a pretty
strong second half kind of coincided
with Sanford coming just to what did he
bring to the team and what did you learn
from a guy you know who's been around
for a while yeah he's a he's a really
good player you know he said he's been
around for a while so there's definitely
things that you can learn from him you
know just the way he works off the ice
and carries himself so you know it was
great to get a guy like that at the
deadline for yourself now going into the
offseason and waiting for the draft
what's running to your mind is that
approaches uh you know not much I think
I've done everything I can now you just
you know kind of let the cards fall into
place and just focus on training and you
know trying to develop as a player so I
come back next year even stronger we're
some of those things that you're
folks I'm working on to Kruger game uh
you know I think just getting in the gym
getting stronger you know as you get
older at some strength should come so
just that and then you know get get on
the ice too and work on you know just
skills and work on my shot and
everything really"
Auston Matthews,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q46jvd-XHI,"in the sort of progress do you feel was
made this season
oh I mean I think it's kind of just easy
to look at it and you know you get out
of the first round and it's a big
probably talking funny but obviously you
know
the main goal of years to you know
Challenge and
um you know when and I still haven't met
that but I think you know throughout the
season there's obviously ups and downs
and adversity that gets thrown your way
and uh lessons and experiences that
um you know they're they're really
important in just the evolution of being
a person a player an organization and a
team
yeah of course when my intention is to
be here I I think I've uh you know
reciprocated that before how much I
enjoy playing here and what it means to
me and the organization my teammates and
how much uh you know I just enjoy being
here so how important to get that done
before next year yeah I think that uh
you know it's important and you know
it'll all kind of work itself out in due
time and
um I just kind of go from there but
um you know as far as everything else
goes I mean it's uh you know like like I
said before I I really do enjoy playing
here and it's it's a true honor and
um you know the work that you know we're
putting into obviously continue to just
strive for that that end result is going
to be motivating religion were you
injured uh in the playoffs
I mean
you get the bumps and bruises and stuff
you deal with certain stuff and
um you know like everybody is and
uh it's just kind of the nature of the
game and the nature of you know playoffs
especially yeah
yeah I mean it was something I was
dealing with a little bit throughout the
season and a little bit throughout the
playoffs I mean in the end it's you know
my job to kind of push through that and
do
what I tell the team win
what do you enjoy about working with
count do this
I mean I think he's a great uh a great
gym I think he's built a really good
culture here
um you know when you talk to guys that
come from other teams and other
organizations and just where he's been
able to kind of build here is uh is
great and I have a really good
relationship with him and
um you know obviously everybody's you
know single online is to obviously when
and when those expectations don't get
don't get mad or you know you fall short
obviously
um you know people you know point the
finger and whatnot but um you know in my
experience with Kyle has been a really
positive one okay
sorry how do you think do you get over
the hunt from the playoffs
I mean if I added all the answers if you
would probably be standing here right
now
um I I think it's just you go through
those experiences and I think like any
team that's won before you you go
through uh you know a lot of stuff that
you know maybe you wish you wouldn't
have or I would prefer not to but you
know I think it's just kind of the
evolution of growing into a team that uh
competes uh for championships year after
year and it puts themselves in positions
to to contend and that's obviously what
we're trying to do here and trying to
build here and
um you know it's no secret that you know
we've fallen short plenty of times and
um you know I think it's just the
motivation factor of you know picking
yourself up after you fall down and just
continue to put the work in and uh with
this group and continue to pull for that
goal considering the group you guys did
have I'm concerned the teams that have
fallen around the league does it feel
like it's even more of a missed
opportunity than some of the other
missed opportunities
uh I mean I think it's easy to say I
think every time you you know you fall
short it feels like a missed opportunity
so I'm not sure
um
you know we played
Boston and they go do the final play
Montreal they go to the final obviously
you know you look at those and you think
of missed opportunities but you know in
the end when you
um when you lose and your season's over
and uh
you can't think of it that way I guess
I'm not ready to leave here and as you
get ready to leave here for the summer
do you get a sense through chatting with
people the exit meetings whether things
might look very different a little
different seismically different when you
come back from the fall yeah I'm not
sure
um
you know I think just the
the sense is
it's kind of up in the air I don't know
another kind of stuff that's out of my
control and I can't really uh comment on
that I guess you have the ability to
have as much voice in this organization
as anybody though
um like you have probably the most power
of any player what would you tell
management about specifically the core
of this team and whether or not they
should be kept together whether it
should be looked at whether they can win
a Stanley Cup oh yeah I think those
conversations are
you know meant to be in private so I
don't know if I'm going to really
comment too much on that I think uh my
belief in you know our core players and
the guys that have been in here is is
never wavered and I still believe in
that so
Austin Kyle's deal is up as GM you
obviously have a close relationship with
him
yet for whatever reason he doesn't
resign this day here how much does that
affect your long-term thinking
I mean look I I understand the question
but it's you know all kind of
hypothetical what if I'm not really
going to comment you know too far on
that like I said I have a good
relationship with Kyle
um and that's really all I have to say
great thanks Austin thank you guys"
Patrik Laine,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpmfEzj1nHA,"i don't know what you expected out of
this season before it began but how did
the reality of this season sort of meet
your expectations
yeah i was kind of
kind of a roller coaster for uh
for myself and for the team obviously
not making it into the playoffs so
that's not not what we're looking for
it doesn't matter where you're at as a
as a team you always want to make it
and you know weren't able to do that
this year so
obviously not not satisfied but
you know there's still uh you know
something to do
thinking to do for uh for us what can we
do to uh to improve for next year to be
uh
be a contender and be uh be in the hunt
um
so yeah it was kind of
kind of disappointing for us but you
know we you know as a team where we're
at and uh we're you know one of the one
of the youngest teams in the league so
we'll uh we'll have time
and can you say now what your injury was
at the end of the season that caused you
to miss the games and do you need any
work done after the season
no it's going to be a secret but
no it's nothing nothing big uh we'll be
fine in uh in a few few weeks or so
will you does that give you a chance to
play in the world championships or
uh
i don't
i don't know yet
i haven't
haven't really decided and uh talked
about it yet but uh
but yeah we'll uh we'll see probably
next next week how i'm feeling and kind
of go from there
one of the big stories this summer is
going to be
you and the contract with this team
um john davidson has said there's been
preliminary discussions things have
been fine so far
do you anticipate any issues with that
you want to be here they want you to be
here
how big of an issue do you think this
could become
um
i don't think it should be an issue you
know they've
they've
expressed they want me here i've said
the same thing
so you know the feeling is mutual and uh
yeah just figure out figure out uh
you know the term and the money and all
that and i think we should be fine yeah
and what is it about the situation
that makes you
want to sign long term
here you're a year away from being able
to choose wherever you want to go why
what about this place makes you want to
study
um i think it's just
just a group we have you know we we have
a great group of guys guys
you know i got to uh be really close to
close with and uh you know excited
about the youth we have and
opportunities we're gonna have in a
couple years and you know definitely
want to be a want to be a part of it and
and you know playing playing here
playing in front of these great fans and
love the city i love everything about
being here so it's just that simple
is there anything else
patrick defensively um
team led up the middle school of
franchise history obviously a correction
that you guys want to make but
where do you feel like that you guys can
get better i know the defense is one
thing but what can you guys as the
forward group do to help in that regard
uh it's just
getting the ozone more i think offense
is the best defense you know when you're
when you're 200 feet from your net it's
uh you know you don't need to play too
much defense but
i think just uh you know help with these
more track track track back a little bit
harder uh you know create turnovers and
just you know stop the cycles and block
shots and all that all that same stuff
and i feel like we could be
we could be way sharper in
in that category but
but yeah it wasn't defensively the
season we we wanted but um but yeah in
that section as well we'll uh we'll have
some thinking to do during the summers
patrick did some of the difficult things
that you went through
during this season those things help you
draw closer
to your teammates did that build more of
a family feel for you here in any way
yeah yeah i'm sure it did you know
it's been it's been a pleasure coming to
the rank every day and everybody's been
been helpful with
with all that i had this year and
just always always wanted to come back
as soon as possible to to these guys and
you know they made it made it a lot
easier for me
so i'll always be
always be thankful for for everyone here
and
so yeah that's definitely a part of it
the big part what i love about this team
you know it's like a like a big family
family atmosphere everybody cares about
each other and that's how it should be
good it's just yeah um you mentioned
earlier you know obviously
the youth with this team and it's
obviously there
how close do you feel this team is to
you know kind of joining those ranks of
potentially joining the ranks of
deafer echelon teams in the league
yeah i think
uh we're obviously not there yet but you
know we
we got you know sillies and johnnies and
you know these guys and
you know they're 18 19 years old and you
know when those guys you know i've seen
it when those guys get to uh you know 20
21 22 you know they're gonna be
they're going to be so much better than
uh than this year and even though they
were they had a really good season while
johnny was here only for uh
for a little bit but you know especially
silly you know he was he was really good
already this year as an 18 year old and
so i can't even
can't even imagine how uh how much
better he's going to be in two or three
years and
you know same with these these other
guys
so it's just super excited about that to
uh
to see those guys play and you know play
with them and uh work with them along
the way and
so that's uh that's what i'm really uh
excited about yeah uh
jake forecheck finishes this season
almost with 60 assistant has like 56 or
sis or something like that um he was
brought in here to you know set players
up set you up that kind of thing what
kind of a
take do you have on his season did you
have fun playing with him this year i
mean you hadn't played with him before
or anything yeah no i did i feel like
you know where when we got put together
during camp i uh
i felt like there was something there
right away and uh got to play with him
quite a bit this year obviously with
you know injuries and all that they were
kind of switching him up a little bit
but
i uh i enjoyed playing with jake he's a
you know hell of a player um obviously
doesn't shoot too much but
that's i guess what my job is
but yeah i was it was a pleasure playing
with them and just
excited to hopefully get the chance to
be
be next to them next year and uh just
you know
work work with them more and be better
next year you go back to finland pretty
quick yeah
i mean how has brad larson helped you
this year specifically uh maybe they
offer you a little bit more freedom than
maybe in the past and the way that
what they expect did you play your game
yeah i think so i think it was kind of a
combination of uh you know not getting
free hands uh
but like maybe it's just a little bit
freedom offensively but at the same time
you still gotta
still gonna work work hard still gotta
track back still gonna play defensively
but you know he would he would give a
little bit more freedom to those
offensive guys who can who can create
create goals and create offense and um
so it was kind of a kind of a mix of
those two and uh yeah it was it was good
it was good for
for me i really liked it i really liked
how
how he handled the whole team
he he found a way to
well
obviously
as a team you know we
couldn't get the job done but i feel
like he handled every player
kind of not the same way but uh kind of
differently
but yeah i was really happy uh
playing uh playing for lars and uh
hopefully play for him in the future too
now also um you finished a point a game
um player for the first time in your
career is that something that matters to
you being able to reach that kind of a
threshold
not really
you know individual stuff doesn't really
matter since uh you know it's a team
sport where to win not get point of game
um so it doesn't really matter well it's
it's always fun to get on the board and
everybody's expecting it when you're
when you're making a lot of money and uh
you're expected to score so that's
that's kind of uh what i'm thinking but
at this time it doesn't really matter
anything because i think a lot of people
think of you as obviously a goal scorer
but
i don't know if it's underrated or not
but do you feel like the play making
side being able to set up goals is
coming along for youtube
no uh no i feel like it's always been
there i feel like i've always been been
a good uh good playmaker good passer but
everybody's always been focused on my
shooting and goal scoring and all that
so it's kind of
maybe it's underrated maybe not but
you know i feel like i've showed it that
i can i can make some make some good
plays
so it's it's a good option to have in
the pocket when uh when you're not not
able to shoot the puck that you can you
can dish it to someone else
finish with jeff i just remember kendall
but i think about a year ago when we had
these interviews and you talked about
how much better you wanted to be after
last season um coming into this year and
even in training camp talking about how
you kind of um really felt like you were
primed for a big year did it just feel
good to be like feel like patrick lainey
again i mean did you feel like you
performed much more in the way that you
wanted to when it seems like this
yeah i think so um
you know last year when i talked about
it you know i
didn't want to go back to that and
needed to take a step
towards the right direction
to the same
same patty that i was in winnipeg and i
feel like there's just so much so much
more that i can offer but
i feel like it was a it was a good good
step for me and uh you know just gotta
take the next step for next year and
um i'm definitely gonna gonna do that
and do uh do everything i can to uh to
make it happen
and uh brian larson has talked a lot
this year about um
not just your goal scoring but just your
your whole game 200-foot game defense
you know pointing away from the puck
things like that how impressive has been
how that's grown this year uh you say
you want to keep growing what's maybe
next as far as uh when you say you wanna
keep getting better what are the next
things you wanna next steps you wanna
take
um
you know i think just uh make it a
winning team i think part of
being in the really good winning team is
just uh
for uh for an offensive guys i think
just decision making um you know when
you're up one
you know parks just got to get deep um
you know those sorts of plays just uh
just recognize the situations you're
gonna you're gonna try something create
offense and
so i think it's that's for all our guys
including myself just
just recognize the situations when it's
time to create offense and when it's
just time to uh you know play it safe
put it deep when you're up a goal when
you're up a couple goals at the end of
the game i think to
the margins are uh you know pretty
pretty small in that
area so just
try to try to do those small plays as
well as we can and we can make this team
a winning team"

Jesse Puljujarvi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkejKDSnJxU,"uh yese welcome back I just wonder how
your uh your off season was and how
excited you are to to be here and and
kind of you know get yourself into a
good spot with the team yeah off season
was great uh I have a good time back
home working out a lot
skate uh enjoy the weather good sun and
yeah try to be better after every summer
and season starting soon
this how how do you how do you think you
carry over the energy you know from from
the playoffs to today you look around
the room how do you carried over no I I
think there's no any
specials uh try to work hard like summer
and get back good confidence and start
there hi Jesse um I'm just wondering
what your your feelings are on coming
back I know the end of last season you
weren't playing as much as you wanted to
and there were some talk that that you
weren't happy and that you weren't sure
if if Edmonton was the right fit for you
where are you at with all of that right
now how do you feel about you know where
you're playing and and being in Emon uh
I feel good uh new season I think no one
has to think about last year it's new
new season and I try to do everything
how good I can and let's see how that
works out but I think uh I'm good spot
I'm good shape and yep you're at least
in the first day of training camp here
with Zack Heyman and Leon dry Sidle how
do you feel about that that looks like a
very good opportunity for you to get
back to being the guy you were at the
start of last season yeah of course
there's couple good players so I try to
fit there and do where I'm
good yesie uh looking back at last
season how would you summarize your game
from start to
finish uh can you repeat yeah so how
would you kind of assess or uh you know
kind of just look back at last season
how would you think your play went can
you repeat again sorry your play last
season Y how did you think it went from
start to finish yeah last last season I
started right really well like first 20
games I had like point a game so that
was really good then there was something
like uh little injury and that kind of
stuff but uh of course the playoffs I
like to play more there but uh we played
team really good last season I and I
think now we start everything again uh
try to be where I'm good and best player
what I can be awesome and sorry about
that and also looking at this season
what do you need to do in order to take
the next step in your game I think I
just need to skate well uh get that
going and help those good guys when when
I'm play with those guys and and of
course when he uh spot to score then
hard shot
Corner Jesse your English is actually
much better uh than it was even 12
months ago how come have you you know
practiced how does it get better uh I
don't know I think
it's
just I'm like every summer I try to be
better player maybe it's the English
coming too there I don't know is it uh
now is it time you have a higher salary
this year you have been here for a few
years you're 24 years old is it time now
for you to take a you know to establish
maybe yourself here in the NHL is it
time is it time is it time is it it is
it is
perfect uh Jesse at the end of last
season Jay Woodcraft was saying and you
you kind of alluded to it too that
injury and maybe that kind of changed
how did the injury kind of affect your
game down the stretch did you did you
find that it changed anything for you no
I think I was good shaped there was no
any cuses about that uh so I don't know
I you there's sometimes what I I do
everything could that good what I can do
and
so I don't know hard to say yeah uh
people look at the second half of your
game and you talked about not scoring as
much but maybe played pretty well around
the other areas of the ice how did you
feel about your game you know let's say
the in 22 like after after the holidays
after Christmas how did you feel maybe
about your game in the second half of
the year uh I don't even remember
anymore um and so you're taking the next
you're trying to take the next step this
year as you talked about exactly yes
yeah what what is they maybe the the one
thing you want to do you talked about
skating in the offensive zone is there
something that you want to do in the
offensive zone to really try to put a
few uh more Pon I think I the four four
check there they I try to be really good
and then hanging out the puck then maybe
other one where I can be better too so
and go to blue paint then there be
strong
mean hanging sorry you said Hanging On
to the puck yeah
that's last year as when maybe you was
losing some confidence perhaps you were
moving the puck moving the puck you
weren't skating with the puck would you
like to get back to being the player
that kind of skates with the puck and
hangs on to it for a while yeah yeah of
course that's uh that's good so yeah try
to be more more confidence player and
that's that's it when you can be with
the buck and Y but it like for you in
Edmonton your fan base other than Conor
McDavid you might be the second favorite
player on this team from the fans uh how
is it to be yesie P yarvi living in
Edmonton walking around meeting people
what's it
like uh hard to say uh I try to be T
myself Jesse uh Moo's not here this year
and I just wonder how things will maybe
be a little bit different for you I know
obviously as your Countryman you guys
you guys were close he's not there how
does that change things for you and and
what will that be like uh nothing
there's other finish guy
now uh new line yeah he's there so no
changes no no so no uh I don't know mik
was good guy good friend for me but
there is no other is guy he's good guy
too but
yeah I try to be good
teammate you mentioned confidence Jesse
every player at times it goes up and
down when you were struggling L did you
lose your confidence and did you learn
on on maybe how to to try to maintain
confidence better it's a tough thing to
do in the NHL yeah I think confidence is
uh big thing uh here in HL you need need
confidence every day every game every
play so yeah try try to be tough guy and
uh play with good confidence that's big
big stuff
yeah thanks"

Alexander Nylander,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nECQvomIm4k,"was today like before you get in the
emergency recall what time did you find
out and what time did you make it into
town yeah I found out in the morning I
went to practice uh right after our team
meeting so I was really happy and really
excited I didn't know if I was gonna be
able to like we didn't know if it was
for sure I was caught up but uh so
excited when they said I was coming so I
just went on a car and I took my car
here so five hours and then just get
ready for the game
he loves did it feel like you might
never get to College you start to wonder
if you would
yeah I've been playing really well
obviously I've had a great year and just
been working hard every day and just
just like you know trying to play my
game and uh I just knew my time will
come I wasn't really stressing too much
about it and I just know if I keep
playing like this so I'm actually Old
Town so just really really happy and
really excited that it came today and uh
it was awesome what did you think of
your performance out there tonight I
think I think a pretty good game for our
first game in NHL I think it was like
three years ago so I think we had we had
to get a lot of good shifts out there
and obviously we had a slow start there
but uh we came back and that was an
amazing win so
it seems like you kept things pretty
simple especially in the first couple of
periods is that a real Focus for you
yeah I just try to not try to do too
much here in the first game and just try
to keep the staple move my feet and uh
try to make some plays um but yeah just
try to keep a simple work hard I always
will try to think out there today there
was one play uh in the defensive Zone
you had a real hard back check to the
back post and I did you end up getting a
stick on that cross crease pass it would
have been there for it to happen yeah
either his stick or that puck I can't
remember what it was but it was one of
those two just focusing on that kind of
stuff throughout this game and working
hard in diesel um so that was my how's
my game plan and I think it went pretty
well"

Tyson Jost,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRcPe7D6IBI,"it became the Buffalo Sabers how
surprised were you when you found out oh
yeah it was a whirlwind
um I mean there's a lot of emotions and
I was excited though obviously there's a
great young Corps here and a lot of
great up and coming Talent just like
watching these guys play it's
fun to watch their team's exciting and
um I think they got a really good thing
going here and they're coming up so I'm
excited to be a part of this group and
just kind of build with these guys and
grow with these guys
happening with Minnesota with you and
Minnesota
um I mean there's a lot going on I don't
think we got off to a great start and um
that was tough when you're not winning
games and um the season that they had
last year I think there's a lot of
pressure there and
um I was kind of trying to find my way
to fit in that lineup and there's a lot
of jumbling and mixing lines and um I
know for me personally it was just kind
of hard to get in our Rhythm but that's
behind me I'm here now my focus is with
the Buffalo Sabers and I want to do
everything I can to help the team win
and go in the right direction here and
work hard and kind of in my spot so I'm
excited
going in the preseason
um I mean I think confidence for sure
and rhythm is one
it was just tough I think uh kind of
when we started off to a slow start
there's a lot of people walking on
eggshells and whatnot and I can't use it
as an excuse but definitely your
confidence kind of lacks a little bit
and when you're not playing with
confidence you're not going to be the
player that you can be so um I want to
get back to that the game that I was
playing in preseason I felt really good
and I was in a rhythm and
um I wasn't really overthinking things
and I think that's what I was doing at
mini just because I was putting a lot of
pressure on myself and that's something
I do so I gotta learn from that and um
and come in here and play my game six
years
kind of evolved into what kind what kind
of area would you say
um I mean I can play up and on the
lineup I think I can play in a lot of
situations in Colorado I kind of did
that I could be a p gay guy I could play
the power play I could play third line I
could I could kind of move up and down
the lineup and play in a lot of
different situations so I think that was
what was nice and in Colorado I really
learned that aspect and learned how to
play in different situations and grow my
game in that sense so I also want to get
back to I mean I have skill and I can
make plays and that's something that the
coaching staff and the general managers
and whatnot have kind of spoken spoken
to me and worded and that's great so I
want to play my game
yeah
in general how much of it is schemes and
approach how much is just just mentality
yeah a lot of it goes into mentality
I mean you got to go out there and you
have to be willing to outwork the pp
every single time and I mean the IHL
there's so many skill players and guys
are going to make plays but if you're in
the right spots and working in your
system it's going to come together and
we're in a sacrifice too and block shots
so I found uh I kind of really
develop myself into a nice PK player and
I pride myself on that and I want to
help out here with with the PK for sure
Jason you're still young you're only 24
years old is that why you look at it
there's still an upside two-year game
because you are still young yeah 100
that's something I just keep telling
myself and that's kind of in the message
of the organization here too and with
kind of my Camp I guess you could say as
well I'm 24 years old I'm I'm uh I'm
still young and you kind of look around
this room and that's why I think I'll
Gel really good with those guys I
definitely can bring some I mean
experience because I've been with
Colorado for so long and I learned a lot
there with that organization and them
having success and I kind of started
with Colorado when we were up we're at
the bottom and we're working our way off
so I think I can bring some leadership
in that aspect but like you said I want
to find my game and I still have a lot
of good years ahead of me and I just got
to get my confidence and I know I can be
the player that I want to be and grow my
game for sure
things are going tough this team is on a
skid right now what what was the keys in
Colorado when things were tough to get
you guys out yeah I know one thing I
mean it's hard coming to the rink every
day when you're losing nobody wants to
lose especially when you're competitive
athletes and um
it's it's it sucks it's not fun when
you're losing but you have to have that
positive mentality you have to come to
the rink every day and want to work and
get better at your craft and get better
as a team and kind of earn that
reputation and earn your earn your
points and it's it's a tough lead every
every night it's going to be a battle
but I think you could come prepared
every single night and keep working to
practice and keep that positive uh that
aspect throughout the room it's going to
go good and with the skill and then
Talent we have in this locker room if we
kind of put that all together I think
we're gonna we're gonna have a really
good team so it's exciting when you got
traded last year
they got to the playoffs did you watch
or could you watch yeah no I couldn't
really watch it I was it was tough it
was it was hard I was with Colorado for
five six years so a lot of my good
friends on that team and to watch them
go on and win it's it's definitely tough
and you kind of think I could have been
there but uh that's the pass and you got
to move on from it and like I said
before in this interview I'm Buffalo
saber now and I'm happy to be here and
I'm honored for the opportunity and I
want to get back to that player I am and
help this team
connections here the players coaches or
anywhere in the organization I guess ah
not really I know a Tage a little bit we
played a couple uh a couple games in the
AHL together we were on a condition to
sing I think that was in San Antonio
when they split between St Louis and
Colorado so
um I mean we knew each other a little
bit from there and then obviously I mean
played against a lot of the guys and a
couple camps here and there but other
than that uh not really but it's a
pretty easy lock room to come into
especially when everybody's young and
excited and wants to get better and has
the same goals in mind so I feel welcome
already coming in here thank you"

welcome to the engineers podcast thanks
for having me fellas it's unbeliever I'm
excited dude are you bummed that you
guys come to La once a year and it's
pouring rain
I am I am I'm a little choked about it
honestly we we had the same thing happen
last year too we come out here and it's
like
you look at this one you Circle this
early on as soon as you get the schedule
and you're like okay like middle of
January or early January it's gonna be
freezing in Boston we're gonna come out
here get some good weather like sit by
the pool all that no rainy rainy every
day we're here I was gonna say I've got
bad news it's raining yeah the whole
time it was raining everywhere yeah so
we were just at the Winter Classic which
by the way congrats on the huge win and
we had that same feeling leaving Boston
I was like I can't wait to get out of
this cold and get back home and then
it's just my flight was turbulence like
you read about and just dumping rain
when we got here I was like God damn it
how was your guys flight by the way did
you get rocked with turbulence or
anything no we were fine we're on the
way here yeah
crazy yeah pouring rain everywhere we it
was fine we had some bad weather uh
the game right before Christmas break uh
the 22nd we were flying that night to
Devil's game Devils game yeah Devils
game terrible like Frozen and windy as
can be we came all the way down so we
got the windows open like we're rocking
back and forth the whole time we're all
like buckled up like nobody ever buckles
up on the plane we're all like strapped
in
and uh we came all the way down so we
got the windows up we're like can you
see the runway
we maybe got like 50 feet away
we're rocking all over and it just the
guy just went right back up took us back
up in the air oh [ __ ] flew around for
another like 20 minutes damn wait for
the wind to kind of yeah it was it was
scary that was probably the scariest
flight we've had I've never been on a
flight that went back up oh we went
right back up I was about to say this
isn't good you've probably dealt with
this being where you're from I've been
on one of those little puddle jumpers
that flew to Nantucket and I'm flying
with a friend who's she gets her pilot's
license and she's like it's great we're
gonna fly out of Boston we'll go to
Nantucket and I'm flying us and you
never want to be like no I'm not getting
in a plane yeah because she doesn't want
to die either no of course but we get in
this plane and when we landed we just we
we bounced yeah right back off and I was
like Lauren I never again you cannot be
like yeah we're all flying in Nantucket
and then you pull that [ __ ] yeah oh
absolutely obviously buying tickets for
the way home leave the place seriously
um so let's talk about the Winter
Classic okay that was I mean not your
first time skating on Fenway but so yeah
you you know I'll beat the Penguins in
on Monday 2-1 great but 2017 when you
were tearing it up for The Bu terrier as
you were there uh beat UMass 5-3 yeah so
I gotta know which one was more exciting
which one was more fun so obviously this
one was the winner classic but like
that's your first time ever seeing the
ice FN where you guys are like five in
the country that year absolutely buzzing
is it hard to beat that first time or
was the Winter Classic so over just just
two like totally different different
groups right like one was college and
this was weird classic like
this is actually kind of funny we so we
won Gold in uh in Montreal World Juniors
uh
like 48 hours before that game
so we're still on our Bender after that
like we went out that night we we all we
took a bus back from Montreal to Boston
we drove back and uh kept it going the
whole way and then the next day we
played at Fenway we won but I remember
that it was like hurting a little bit
going into that game there was it was
the noon game I think Providence played
Boston College that was like the big one
and they played at like 7 P.M so that
was like a lot of fans on NASA I
remember already back in the dorm
watching that one we were the noon game
not many people there freezing cold like
Sunny so you had the glare like the high
noon there yeah yeah uh coming straight
from Montreal yeah exactly but we did
win and it was and it was a lot of fun
this was this was night and day like
this was the coolest yeah coolest game
but yeah that I've ever played in like
by far do you so you think fans were
unbelievable like
just I don't know just everything about
it was sick like did a good job with the
outfits all about yeah yeah weather was
perfect you weren't too high you weren't
too cold the ice was good everything
about it was just like it was just
really well done and then to win come
back and win like in that fashion was it
was just a ball on top um pump the ice
was good because that was a huge worry
when it was going to be warm I pumped
the rain hell off I feel like it rained
yeah completely surrounding the game but
you got yeah on a perfect day oh that
was amazing the best part about that was
it it hung on uh the day before too
because they were gonna cancel the
family and the outdoor practice so we
didn't have that I was hurt when we were
in uh Notre Dame for the Winter Classic
for whatever four years ago five years
ago
so they canceled the outdoor practice
everybody practiced at Compton which is
Notre Dame hockey's uh rink and then the
family skate was there
so like sick yeah exactly
exactly and they're all there and they
had fun I still had a picture with my
family and everything but like this was
the full this was the excuse me the
experience that like everybody thinks of
when you when you think of the Winter
Classic when you're like a kid and they
used to do the uh
the HBO like uh 24 7. yeah no it's the
winner Club yes you see all that like
everything about it like this was this
was everything you had the family ski
you had the outdoor practice you had all
of it like
in the Red Sox locker room everything
about it it was just it was perfect and
I know you guys don't get to see this
but the environment outside like at the
bars around the game yeah for hours like
we showed up at like 9 00 a.m yeah his
Line's down the street to get into you
know game on cask and flags right now I
was like oh my god dude yeah
yeah exactly we've drove right past
Jillian's we used to go there all the
time the bowling alley yeah yeah right
yeah and it's like it's like a Dave and
Buster's in there yeah that's it that's
fine not not saying anything bad about
Tahoe but this obviously blew Tahoe out
of the water blue Tahoe way Tahoe is
great don't get me wrong and like it was
like the scene the scene there was
amazing the backdrop being so cool Lake
Tahoe and everything like
that was great
um no family
was tough no fans was like it was just
like that's right yeah yeah there was
nothing there
they just dropped that in the middle of
that golf course there in Lake Tahoe and
we played yeah and then
yeah so it was really hard to kind of
compare the two
because like I don't know everything
about Cove had made that weird like
didn't even really explore Tahoe at all
because it was covid so like you're just
in the hotel and I don't know it was
just different yeah this this photo yeah
it felt like so from our perspective
like the fans perspective the stuff on
social media that you see the buzz
around Boston leading up to this game
was out of control and you just said it
kind of felt like that road to the
Winter Classic literally living it yeah
you guys obviously between Christmas and
this game played Buffalo did that game
feel like a blip on the radar for you
guys because there was so much build up
and planning going towards the Winter
Classic or well like no because like
they've been good this year like you
can't Overlook a team like that and yeah
for sure and I mean you don't you don't
overlook any team in the league you can
lose on any given night to anybody so no
uh
you're not looking past that game we
knew what we were playing for because at
home we were like we wanted to get out
of the calendar year without losing or
yeah in regulation yeah uh and that game
we should we should have won that game I
mean we had it uh you know they tied it
up late and then dude over time real
quick I was literally scared to text you
because we were setting this up and I'm
like watching the game and you guys come
back and I was like God Charlie's gonna
be so fired up I can't wait to hit him
up after this game oh it was like bang
tied yeah let's hit him up a little
catch you later yeah I was like well
yeah after this so we knew we were
playing for we had like some good
incentive like hey let's let's make it
to 23 without losing in regulation yeah
that's that was pretty cool so I mean
yeah we lost what we did but more so in
that game you're thinking like okay
just get get through and don't get hurt
because you're like you're so good point
you know that the Winter Classic is next
you're like please like nothing stupid
nothing like just make it through that
game and uh and then when you do
you you know you made it you know you're
healthy and you're gonna play yeah I
mean I was freaking out you you might
have not even clocked this but I was
freaking out those couple days before
there was some tweet from you know I
think it was like Pluto or something
that omark tweaked something and left
practice Yeah Yeah God damn it like and
I was thinking for him how miserable
that must have been but then like five
minutes later he was back on the ice and
I was like yeah
it was it was brutal because because
last law
the one at Notre Dame when I didn't get
to play like that was so brutal because
it wasn't
I didn't have any broken bones or
anything what happened I actually took a
a Jeff Petry shot
right off the heel I'm like boxing
someone out in front and this thing just
hits me right in the heel
it exploded my my foot like it was crazy
so like the skin yeah yeah so I needed
like five stitches yeah after the game I
take my sock off I got Curt chilling
sock yeah so I'm all bloody and I'm like
what the hell happened
like broke the skin there is no skin on
the heel so when you're trying to like
Stitch it up like you can't like
put it put it back together so it was
really weird and then like I played with
it all the way up to Christmas so that
was like what December 15th so I played
like five more games it was like
lidocaine
before every game every time I was put
on the skate practice end game like just
to get it into a ski because it hurt so
bad
and it ended up getting infected so I
went home back yeah yeah damn it so I
was I don't even know it sucked I should
have been taking probably like
antibiotics like preemptive ones while
while if I knew I was gonna play through
it
went home for Christmas I'm in New York
now uh wake up Christmas Day this thing
looks terrible they sent a picture of
the doc he's like you gotta get back to
Boston and see oh [ __ ] up like open
presents with the family I'd even stay
for dinner I like turned right around
got a flight and left Christmas Day
so that sucked and then and then I know
I'm like okay well I've been playing
with it I know I can play with it
so is Doc gonna clear me and uh it ended
up being like
it's not worth like losing your foot
yeah it's not worth losing that bad I
don't know it was it was infected yeah
it was and they were words so it was
kind of On The Fringe of like did I have
to stay did I have to go to the hospital
to do like the IV uh antibiotics yeah
yeah or could I just do oral antibiotics
and like just walk around the boot and
do all that so
had the boot on and everything and I'm
like now we're going to the Winter
Classic so I missed the game the 27th
the 29th we're going there play on the
first and I'm like Doc every day I'm
like look at it does it look better they
look better like look better look good
enough
um and then he you know he we're out
there and it was kind of like a split
second like oh can I can I do it can I
go and and he wouldn't clear me yeah
yeah
yeah you got a [ __ ] trench foot yeah
Charlie blocks a shot and gets
gangreneur and then it's all over so
that was that was even harder though
because like if you got a broken foot or
whatever like you can't play like you're
medically ruled out so I'm like Doc this
is kind of wishy-washy though like yeah
just let me play like I know I can play
um but it was always yeah aired on the
side of caution yeah well I got my I got
my Winter Classic in it I was gonna say
that undefeated at Fenway in your life
pretty sick I was laughing with Dan
actually it's it's nice to play to go to
Fenway this year and you got uh Linus
Hallmark and that who's been unconscious
all year and then I was looking up your
bu team and I was like yeah you just had
some trash freshman uh Jay cottinger and
yeah awful at the position yeah I was
like wow that's a pretty good backstops
at Fenway bud you were so loaded the few
teams was stacked yeah we had otter in
that and then
me and me and Fabs on the back and uh
Chad Chris who's still playing pro a lot
of guys who Greenways on that everyone's
playing no Greener was on that team
um Keller was on that team like yeah we
were pretty good because we're a wagon
very good um I need I was talking about
this on our live when we were at the
game and I had been noticing it on just
like through photos and stuff and I'm
gonna be devastated if truly there was
nothing going on
obviously both teams great setups
jerseys you guys walking into the Red
Sox jerseys all that stuff's amazing
what the [ __ ] was going on with marshy's
gloves they were different he's am I I'm
not crazy yeah yeah I painted him I okay
gold uh
like the shittiest arts and crafts jobs
you've ever seen yeah there's a spray
painted gold he's he's like
he's a freak about uh the gear he loves
his gloves so like his gloves are beat
to [ __ ] yeah and
he he got the new pair Warriors sent him
a pair of new ones and he was like
there's not a chance I'm using these
yeah yeah so he used his he had a you
know he's got a pair of
a couple pairs of black ones that
rotates
uh he just spray painted one and they
don't care they're like go ahead do
whatever you want I don't like I don't
know I'm like are we gonna get fired
like the league did the league fine for
[ __ ] like that I don't even know but
yeah it looked I mean because you could
tell it you could tell you yeah and
what's funny is I I I'm glad I'm happy
to hear that his gloves are beat to [ __ ]
because it looks like his gloves are
always falling off his hands all the
time during the game yeah and then
looking at pictures I was like this
dude's gloves are different than the
rest of the team and what's funny is he
didn't even get the right color I mean
no yeah I'm sure he just went out and
got gold spray paint was like I'm gonna
do my best here dude whatever spray
paint we had lying around the rink was
was what went on yeah what went on there
yeah yeah I mean I imagine marshy's out
there on the ice face washing someone
they're getting high from spray paint
fumes he just got spray paint all over
his mitts oh my God unbelievable
um looking at that game uh you know when
we're there and they're doing all the
pre-stuff and you've got all these
Boston sports legends there you know
it's like they got veritech there and
then I think [ __ ] was there before right
you guys are yeah around with him yeah
it was it was and then obviously Chiefs
there Bobby Orr and then Big C D yeah
must have been nice to see Bigsby again
and then what I need to know
you come into the league and you're
immediately playing with Chara who's
like one of the greatest defensemen in
the history of the NHL one of the
greatest leaders of all time what was it
like being becoming so close to him both
as a teammate and then also a d partner
with this dude who is twice your age and
then also let's be real Z's got to be a
bit of a lunatic in in terms of his
preparation the way he takes care of his
body and all that stuff like what was
your relationship and is your
relationship like with Chara
uh well first I have those those Legends
were were pretty cool hey so it was yeah
yeah chief
Chief Bobby and z and then I think that
was veritech yeah and uh Wakefield right
and wait yeah
yeah so that was sick like they they had
Bobby shoot one to various
to throw a knuckleball to Omar yeah
Bobby skipped the two Hoppers I know
yeah I was actually at least Tech
scoopers I was impressed with tech like
he scooped up yeah that was really well
done then then right after that or or
right after the anthem they had the
flyover I wish I knew that was coming I
should have known that I was coming they
would do that because they come they
come so fast that by the time I like you
hear that you hear them coming like you
look up and like they're already they're
gone because they come right over but it
that was sick
um
yeah so that was that was cool that was
cool it was really well done that they
did that and then and then with z
um
man it was just
unbelievable like I remember coming in
the first day and I met him and I called
him Mr Chara and he's like oh call me Z
like you know whatever yeah and our
relationship just evolved from there and
get to be D partners with them for you
know it's like four years
um learned so much uh really got
I just I got way better I got I got way
better
as a defenseman
learning from him and you know being
held accountable by him uh
so many things and you know on the ice
off the ice
he
he does take care of himself like insane
he works out every day
um and I was vegan for for a while I
don't know if he still is but uh
everything that he puts into his body
like it's only if it's gonna make him
better yeah and everything he does is
like
it's a hundred and ten percent and
it was pretty like apparent like once
you get
uh you know spend some time around them
that you you like understand you're like
okay no I get it how this guy's still
playing because he's a machine and what
he does like he the way he takes care of
himself the way
he recovers everything he does is is in
the mindset of like how am I gonna get
better yeah
um
which is something you just have to
admire it really sure and and then as a
person just a human being like what an
unbelievable guy like he's just such a
gentleman and
and
just like a larger than life figure
literally and figuratively in every way
into you like do you ever make a bad
play when you were young and he just let
you have it on the bench no man he's
unbelievable there there be times when
like you know he
like
maybe like yell
like he was just like I don't know we he
never snapped on me ever ever struggled
to think of him doing anything yes
exactly like so like there's times when
I yelled my name
um to get my attention you know during a
play or something like that like but
never and I made a ton of mistakes and
honestly that like
really does a good job of explaining
like just who he is and
um you know his leadership abilities
everything he was able to get across to
me you know without ever having to do
that yeah
um
and I also was very attentive to to
everything he said like as soon as he
opened his mouth you just listen
and you respect and the utmost respect
for for him and everything you know
because he's because he's earned that
yeah you deserve that but yeah he never
he never snapped on me man he was
[ __ ] always just a true General yeah
and that leads into I mean you go from Z
to now Berg who is I mean by all
accounts truly the greatest human being
who's ever lived yeah and is it
interesting I mean it's obviously such a
blessing to have two guys like that that
you've learned from that you've gotten
to play with but now also at 25 being a
leader of the team now like you're
wearing the a in many many games
is it weird following in the footsteps
of two of arguably the greatest captains
in the history of the NHL like what's
how's it feel with that
I don't know like it's so crazy to think
that I've got to play with with both of
them continue to play with Bergie like
they're two of the best human beings
that I've ever met like just the way
that they treat people and like take
hockey out of the equation because
they're hall of fame hockey players yeah
but just as people
like they're unbelievable people the way
they the way they treat people the way
they care for
for their teammates each other like
I don't know man I just feel really
blessed like to get to play with those
guys honestly like it's not something
that I take
for granted and I would say about Z it's
not something that I ever took you know
lightly and or
you know would stop and and realize like
just how lucky I was to get to have him
as a partner yeah
and then now it's Bergie and bergy's
picked up you know where where's he left
off and and
really just like
okay I can't think of someone the two of
them
people who embody what it means to be a
leader and a captain of a team like
those are the two
perfect like just look at them that's
what I'm saying it like they're exactly
what I think
it means to be a captain everything that
they do and how they carry them yeah
it's funny just as fans of the game
looking at the Bruins organization when
Z was retiring and it's like well this
has got to be the easiest handoff yeah
yeah there's no like oh [ __ ] who's the
captain now it's like oh you yeah you
have another oh you have a guy who also
like could have been wearing the C like
they should they were always
co-captained yeah
you know only one of them could wear the
C though but but burgie was uh
Bergie was always like a very vocal
leader where where z
um when he would talk
it was oh it was kind of like few and
far between so it made his word so much
more meaningful like when he would stand
up and talk
um but burgie is a different kind of
leader like the way he brings it is is
he's
consistent he brings it every day the
same way
um you know definitely more vocal than Z
was uh
two different leadership styles but like
he was always doing that all along yeah
and he's always been a leader since
forever like yes I think that dude was
born a lady yes he was leading groups on
the 2011 team is when he kind of stepped
in like I heard stories when he kind of
stepped into that role there like
to really kind of lead that team from a
vocal standpoint like from a you know
Captain standpoint
um and at that point I think he just had
an a if yeah if he even had an a uh so
he's always been doing that and like
that's something that kind of you know
every team has guys like that who don't
even wear letters who are who are really
instrumental I'm actually surprised that
Berg is so vocal you know like when I
think of burger I picture him like the
really quiet yeah talks listen yeah but
Berg never speaks to the point that I
wonder if Char is so quiet that it made
Berg talk more like he's like dude
say something that's amazing okay I want
to talk World Juniors okay 2016. you're
on the squad great run beat by Russia
Redemption against Sweden bronze medal
game take that home 2017 you come back
and in Canada right you guys win your
group beat Canada 3-1 win your group
beat the Swiss epic shootout against
Russia
playing Canada in the final beat them in
a shootout and you had urna in that
tournament too six points in seven games
golden assist in the final monster goal
too by the way you guys are down to
nothing yeah that was a big one tie it
up go down 4-2 tie it again I don't know
shoot out Troy Terry on his shootout
[ __ ] after his yeah impression
incredible I would we were having so
much fun watching that tournament as
does everybody watching Bedard be a true
psychopath out there I think the check
just be Sweden right now we're watching
after practice
15 checks on our team I was gonna say
Boston although yeah truly the Bruins
are the check representative in the end
yeah seriously yeah so an absolute tilt
right now in the other semi-final game
and so we would just love to hear what
what's that tournament like like what
were your two experiences there and like
tell us everything about that because it
seems like the coolest thing that's ever
happened yeah I want to know if it is
man it's so freaking cool like when you
grow up as a kid like I remember
um and it was
it was actually kind of funny because it
speaking of the Winter Classic like as a
family
the New Year's Eve game was always USA
Canada
um they would always make the exception
and I know now sometimes they don't like
they weren't in the same group this year
um but it used to never be like that it
was always USA Canada no matter what
people finished in the year before like
it was always USA Canada and that New
Year's game
um so we would like make a big thing you
know around it and growing up like
those guys
were my absolute Idols watching the
world juniors and yeah for Team USA and
it was
it was so freaking cool and so surreal
to to make it to that and then to get to
play in both of them too so it kind of
had that that first year as a freshman
at bu and then the second year two two
different experiences one was in Finland
so we were in Helsinki the first year
loaded team yeah uh
you could honestly argue that that team
was better like
than the year after when we won the
whole thing because we had a lot of
Talent on that team that first year uh
we didn't get it done we ran into Russia
and they were they had a really good
goalie
um I think it might have been uh
Maybe
it was either Sam snow or Georgia
um I don't even remember but they but
they were good that was a devastating
lot like
devastating when he was lost we went up
one nothing too I know so we went up on
nothing early and
you know you start feeling all those
emotions of you know just a hockey game
you're like all right we're up or
nothing like yeah
like you know and just the Ebbs and
flows like they end up tying it up and
then you know scoring
it's currently lose that one
um
second year
second year was cool because that that
was like
our group
because when you plan Ann Arbor
uh that 97 age group so we had
pretty much like that entire team back
for the world of Juniors like it felt
like a like a big family reunion we had
you know maybe like
13 14 of the 20 guys from Ann Arbor on
that team that 97 birth year and then
you filled it in with the other best
guys around college and everybody else
in Junior and like and and we were we
were really good but
I mean from our perspective it felt like
another kick at the can for you guys
exactly yeah
yeah exactly and like
and that group's different because the
familiarity that we had
from that 97 team and how close we were
like we didn't skip a beat so now we're
all back together everybody's two years
more mature
you know everybody's got college
experience now and and everybody's two
years better at hockey yeah so we bring
that team back together and like that
like love family thing that we had from
from there yeah just translated
immediately and it was like boys like
let's let's do this God and we went wire
to wire we freaking we won every game in
that tournament twice really hard to do
in in any tournament if you have a team
twice
um beat Russia
that that shoot I was
the tournament
took years I can only imagine dude but
like five hole Terry like
are you kidding me I I was still like
we'll watch that thing every time World
Juniors comes back because this time of
year like someone will post it yeah yeah
and bring it back and like it'll never
die and I hope it doesn't because that
was one of the coolest things I've ever
been a part of like
we had to have it I think on like
two of those goals
then the Russia shootout yes correct to
keep it going I think like the [ __ ]
pressure are you kidding me there were
two do or die two doer dies I think and
if I were trolley I would watch that
YouTube video before everything before
everything I would just be like this I'm
the best I'm the [ __ ] man I know I
will never not be this incredible I
watch it every single day oh my God and
like I just remember like the the
feeling
both of those coming off the bench when
he won it
um and everybody's diving into each
other and that was just to go to the
gold medal game but like the feeling was
insane and then to Win It
that game was insane in itself like two
nothing come back tied up in the second
house 2-2 and then
you know there's 10 minutes left in that
game and all of a sudden they score
again it's four to two and it's like
okay they We're not gonna be able to do
it again right no we scored a
uh pretty quick
came down the wall got it passed it to
Bellows uh through the crease backhand
over to him and and he scored 30 seconds
later it's like this shit's not done
yeah tied it up
um I think they honestly probably had
the better looks in overtime if I
remember it was 20 minutes five on five
and no one was able to score they had a
power play in overtime I remember which
was speaking about years off your life
man that 20 minutes oh my God are you
[ __ ] me like how no one scores how
you guys we had a couple chances
actually like a couple in the in the
crease I think
um but they did too
and nobody scored and then yeah and then
you just knew we had a troiteria
I feel pretty confident about it when
you go into the shootout in that gold
medal game after what had just happened
like you know on their bench they're
like [ __ ] they're they're a
[ __ ] guy too he had it man he had it
he made a good move on parse and like I
think it was uh wa on uh
Vegas I think he's on Vegas yeah
he leg kicked
and went forehand backhand and he had
Paris dead to rights and he just any and
he lost it lost the puck
and we won and oh my God I I Javelin
javelined my stick we're all trying to
get off the bench as fast as we can and
I'm like every time I was trying to lift
my leg up someone was jumping and I like
couldn't get off the bench
just pure freaking Elation man that was
that is for sure that the coolest thing
my my favorite hockey memory for sure oh
really wow that's a great stat are we as
uh Winter Classic in top three now for
sure top three I mean
the finals would have been would have
been number one if we wanted if we win
that game seven but
yeah it's got to be the memories where
you win so far yeah you would take it
but we'll take it dude speaking of your
stick so we're talking about marshy that
mutants spray painting his glove so I
can't I'm never gonna forget that's so
funny uh so when we were talking to
dutchie he's talking about how much he
changes his stick you don't do a damn
thing to your stick is that correct like
you are same curve staying same Flex
yeah I'm using grip all over it I'm just
[ __ ] p92. I've been using the stats
first it's the psychic then it's uh yeah
well no at first it was the Eiserman
then it was the psychic and then it was
the hall the Taylor Hall yeah yeah it
was not my teammate yeah and uh
yeah just the generic stick I've always
used that sacket curve and then my Flex
has changed so I was like
you know 85 I think in USHL and then I
went up to like 100 and then now I'm
back down I use 95. okay grip the whole
way down as grippy as you can make it I
use like
they have like a special grip power mix
um are there regulations on that like
does the league allow you or can you no
you can do whatever you want yeah for
your stick I think it's just uh
are there curve rules I think like you
maybe you can't have too much used to be
yeah I don't know yeah right like they
used to like check people's sticks yeah
I don't know yeah exactly yeah no they
have like this one it's like
there's all these grips and then they
have this one that's just all the way
over here that's literally the grippiest
thing is it like just for you or is it
like I'm sure there's probably more
people do you go all the way down the
holes all the way grip the whole way
um I've been using the same knob for for
years yeah I don't really change many
things up oh hold on
what you're going grip all the way down
to the blade pretty much yeah I think
they cut off like maybe I don't know how
much of that is superstition because
there's no way you're you're really
using that low on this no no no no no no
but uh
I don't know it's just preference I
guess yeah I mean listen I get it we've
all got well because Bauer actually sent
me these sticks so they went like uh
they went all the way
well usually goes all the way so yeah
pretty much to the blade yeah I have
grip these ones came like probably like
a foot off the blade was where the grip
stopped yeah so no when are you ever
gonna have your stuff that's what I'm
saying like maybe then I would be like
yeah but then I was like oh you know I'm
lining up for face-offs and like I got
you know two hands on it and whatever I
just I hated the feeling of not having
the grip even when I was down there even
though you don't play like that
so I
I like send them back and got new ones
with all with the grip yeah [ __ ] all the
way down all the way just [ __ ] grip
the [ __ ] out of it like because I hated
the feeling of the grip like when I was
like it was like I wanted like to be so
smooth like oh like were you walking
like the yellow Center I was gonna say I
was early on that yellow Synergy game
yeah the yellow Synergy good stick I
love the the silver one that was blue at
the bottom oh yeah the stealth yep
I think honestly the best hockey stick
ever made is the uh the s17 oh yeah yeah
oh yeah that thing is a wedding yeah
absolute weapon I only use Eason as a
kid
and then I don't even a couple guys were
we're hanging on using them like
who would Castle maybe yeah I'm still an
Ola Tang was using them for a while and
like they had been dead and now I don't
think anybody uses them anymore yeah
just a travesty by the way yeah they
were first to the game I mean they were
nothing even touched synergies for so
long the coolest thing I'd ever seen
yeah and yeah it's sad to see them some
gone now it's brutal brutal stuff but
okay super grippy yeah yeah my last
question on the sticker you whiter black
tape guy black let's go I can't I dude
like using white bums me out I've tried
using white there are times I like use
it in practice or something and I would
feel like I like had a foreign object in
my hand yeah like I couldn't just don't
like the luck I agree I don't like the
look The feel I don't know I'm very like
particular I guess about both a black up
top and realizing now that I'm really
particular about some of this [ __ ] I
mean I feel like we all I mean I have to
be like what you like you gotta like
what you like if you [ __ ] up there there
are a lot of guys that that do chain
stuff like they'll change Flex during
the year like they'll change uh you know
patterns and stuff like that they'll go
black tape white tape like I can't do
any of that like I'm so small-minded and
in term like I like what I like and I
just don't change anything about it and
that's kind of I don't think that's my
mind I think like in a world full of
variables we need a few constants yeah
just like give me one stick please it
just is the same way what do you have a
like a pre-wrap knob or do you tape your
knob no I try that tell me about your
knob Charlie it's basically what okay I
want to hear all about it I tried that
the uh the one that like you slide right
on yep yeah like uh buttons I think yeah
yeah I think that's right yeah so I
whatever I use them for a little just
because I thought they were easy
um
didn't feel like as good as when you
just do it yourself so yeah
I go uh
take a roll of white tape and I do this
yeah yeah I got like the you know the
really like thin
um
I don't even know how to explain it and
then I'll do a couple laps around the
top of the knob with that and then I
keep it going down
um just as far as my hand can go yeah uh
so nothing nothing crazy and then I
always use the uh like the sticky yellow
sticky tape on the top oh yeah it was
the grippiest thing yeah so even more
the Howie's tape yeah is that it yeah
that's the best I love incredible
unbelievable okay another thing we
talked about duchy's number and I have a
number question for you so you wore
seven at bu yeah
um is that your favorite number y7 and
did you wear that growing up too was
that no 25 was my favorite number always
okay yeah you wore that for USA I wore
25 and then Arbor I wore the world
juniors I wore it every time I could
um
25 was always my favorite number uh
because it adds to 25 ads to seven no I
just went seven because I had a couple
to choose from and uh and I just landed
on on seven
um college is different so Brandon
Fortunato worried at bu so I didn't have
a chance and then uh [ __ ] Carlo
Brandon yeah Brandon's yeah the brand
yeah wow
he made it in a year early uh a year
before me and he was 25. so don't lie
when that when you saw him get to the
bees and he took Twins were you pissed
yeah oh I didn't know that you don't
know offer him some money dude until you
make it like yeah I'm not like oh my God
no no my mind was never like hey he took
my number that I'm gonna be wearing here
that's good it's a good answer dude no
until you make it you don't never well
one thing I loved was I'm like okay you
have seven you know because like I'm
watching you in college and everything
I'm like okay he's wearing seven at bu
yeah playing World Juniors you're
wearing 25 and I'm like oh yeah that's
the seven then you go to Providence
we're 43 and I'm like yes
I was like dude this is a big one I was
like oh [ __ ] like I was like waiting for
you to grab 61. yeah I was like
something it always does that out of the
seven right but then I saw that you were
like because obviously dude like 25
numbers are already taken on the big
Squad yeah retired numbers when you get
called up you don't have a lot to choose
from right so no I saw you said it was
like 58 yeah there were some good ones
actually like they were you know like so
you got like I think I like Latang with
58 couple couple guys wear that and then
like uh 76 was there so like like yeah
like
a couple like numbers that guys had had
worn that were that were cool
um
so I knew I I knew I didn't want to do
58 I knew I wanted to involve a seven
because
when I was in school so then it was
either like 74 76 or 73 and
I don't know I just I thought 773 was
cool it's a sick number yeah I thought
it was cool I don't know I just wanted I
was like I didn't want to wear 76 I
didn't want to wear 58 because I wanted
to do my own thing so I didn't want to
like be like a repeat of that sure yeah
didn't really know anybody who ever were
73 and like it happened to be Michael
Ryder yeah like the older Bruins
um but I wasn't a Bruins fan when I was
growing up so I didn't even know I'm
like I'm just gonna trailblaze 7-3 here
and see see what happens I loved it I
I'm I see kids like youth hockey kids
everybody kids wearing 73 like
definitely yeah it's really cool it's
really cool I'm a big numbers guy and
when you were picking your number I was
like the bees were in this weird run of
every defenseman was wearing a number in
the 40s or the 50s yeah and I was like
don't please God don't worry nothing for
43. it was like barkowski had 40.
that one did they have it when you came
up when you got called up with someone
already in 43 uh I don't know when I no
I never played with Bart
um
well when I went to Prav they just gave
it to me like I didn't pick a number in
Pro they're like hey yeah Jersey yeah
yeah yeah sounds good wear this uh and
then in the league I don't know
so 43 is maybe a veil maybe yeah it
could have been yeah I don't I don't
know I don't know I do love that you
know once you got it and you you then
you get the chance to change and you're
like no this is this is my yeah I was
like I'll stay yeah like I love that
yeah that's you know seeing a couple
McAvoy jerseys in uh in the stands and
just feel bad yeah I feel bad I don't
want to change now I gotta get a custom
McAvoy 25 I think okay yeah that'd be
pretty what could have been yeah yeah
just in a parallel you just rub it in
Carlos yeah you and Carlo Jersey swap
maybe I know there were some numbers
after that year too like that opened up
and I had Warden 44 in juniors I love
that number like Pronger
um so that was their uh 25 was taken but
like more stuff came available like when
you go to training camp the next year
and it's like you know they're like you
don't have to wear yeah they're Charlie
seriously you can take seven yeah yeah
you can For the Love of pick a different
one like you can get your first choice
and uh and I'm like no like things went
pretty well yeah oh yeah I'll leave it
yeah

it was Halloween was when we first met
uh what were you dressed as uh Steve the
pirate obviously the pirate and she was
a mermaid yeah
we'll get to that yeah it was fun but uh

something yeah uh so I go to World
Juniors that was the years in Finland uh
come back and like I think it was right
when I got back which was right around
New Year's I think he got hired so now
he's the coach of the Penguins so he's
in wilkesbury and then he was with
Pittsburgh wins the Stanley Cup that
year yeah and then like you know ever
since he's obviously had unbelievable
success there but they're amazing family

seven years being Kai and like for sure
yeah I've gotten so close with them and
they're they're incredible people and it
makes for some fun you know hockey
roweries but uh but no it's it's nothing
but just mutual respect really of course
yeah I bet the lead up it's tough for
her because like yeah she's like I hope
you have a hat trick but the only way
for my dad to like have a good game is
if they win yeah right so if you get
three goals would they win like then you

to college she was seven or I was 17 she
was 18.
um
yeah man
we met it was uh so like you know
everybody gets like their group of
friends so the hers was like a couple
girls that lived on the same floor as
her one of the guys on the team started
hooking up with one of her friends uh so
they all met and they're together at
this point like I have no idea who she
is or any of those girls and he was like
Hey like there's this girl I think like
she's kind of into you like you guys
should you should meet and so I shot my
shot yeah threw it out there
yeah I've got my shot and uh and we were
like yeah like you know Halloween's next
week like we're going to this party
after the game it was really cool we
played Denver that night and beat him in
overtime at again yeah and then yeah and
then we went out right after and you
know yeah we intermina at that party the
rest is history good unbearable okay now
I want to get into your family a little
bit your dad Charlie McAvoy senior
nickname The Wolf by the way wolf
unbelievable Nick how do you know about
the wolf dude dude just let's not get
into that let's talk about this why is
Chuck senior the wolf the wolf I'm
pretty sure I think it was Bruce Fox So
Adam Fox's dad who who called him the
wolf
and I don't know like
we're all kids so we played on the same
team the Long Island goals uh when we
were growing up me and Foxy and like my
dad was was he was an animated hockey
Dad yeah
um you know those early years like
he's good now he's good yeah yeah he
figured it out but he was definitely
still banging on the glass on NHL games
he was an animated hockey dad uh so I
think he was just born out of that
because he was he was a yeller yeah he
was Alan at the Moon yeah
so he turned in I love it I was about to
say uh it's unreal that you know you and
Foxy knew each other growing up but I
need a TV show of the wolf and the fox
yeah
her dad just Bruce was shredding ways
well they're they're amazing people too
the foxes they're a great family like
Bruce was funny Bruce would always sit
in the corner by himself and all those
games and whenever Adam would do
something bad or like you know we
weren't playing well it was just always
two hands then he would just throw him
like that's garbage yeah garbage you
knew you see you see him yeah he's an
anime
okay so uh your dad and your uncle have
family business McAvoy Plumbing and
Heating in Long Beach uh I think like
their grandparents sorry grandfather
started like 1929 yeah
yeah okay so and and also he was your
coach growing up your dad yeah and I I
saw an awesome thing that you were
saying um you know obviously you want to
be a forward and going bar down in front
of the ladies yeah don't we all but then
your dad was like listen I don't need
the other parents bitching at me while
my kids up on first time yeah you go to
play D you're playing D yeah you're like
okay nobody wants to play D right so he
was like whatever I'm the coach and you
don't have a choice he put me back
worked out pretty nice yeah you know
we'll take it around a little I'll put a
little forward and then D and then I
went back forward when I was like 12 and
then uh
and then I played forward that whole
year
um
and then someone got hurt they're like
we need another defenseman so I went
back go back yeah played like two shifts
on D
and I'm like that's it I'm never going
back to Florida like it's way more yeah
I touched the puck way more yeah
everything like I just felt like I came
back home yeah so we were wondering you
know just talk about how your dad your
whole family your mommy three sisters
and just Long Beach itself growing up
there helped shape you into you know the
person you are the player you are all
that just like that whole childhood
scene because it seems like you're not
not to interrupt but it seems like with
everything you do with the way you
handle yourself with teammates with the
way you're hearing yourself in your
personal relationships like you are a
family guy and you know so are we and it
just seems like such a cool and awesome
and an experience you're very grateful
for to be able to have such an unreal
support system yeah it's like it's
tight-knit community and
um you know small town values I think
like you just you know grew up with
you know Dad worked incredibly hard my
mom was just full-time mom
um
and
just really under the mindset of like
you have to work for everything my dad
worked his ass off to to give us
everything and like to give me a chance
to to play hockey my sisters played
hockey they played other sports like he
so he did everything for us
um
so I definitely learned a lot through
that and then the perspective you have
once you kind of grow up and mature a
little bit and then you kind of realize
like okay like you know what actually
like how hard he was working and all the
sacrifices and stuff like that and then
I think that sort of helped me
kind of become who I was going to be as
an adult
um you know and their support really and
then everybody from from Long Beach
um all the people I grew up with I think
you know sort of that blue collar worked
for everything Bob yeah
um it definitely defines a lot of who I
am for sure yeah in in honor of the
family business McAvoy plumbing and
heating would you describe your game
more as Plumbing or Heating
uh
think about this now this this is like
yeah this is hard hitting
the beauty is there's no wrong answer
yeah there's no wrong answer I
I feel like in my head like I'm thinking
like plummet like a plumber as like a
grinder yeah maybe like a heater as like
a skill guy I don't know if that's
completely stupid I kind of like that if
it makes sense why you're such a two-way
guy yeah like your whole family Legacy
is built on a Tuesday it's unbelievable
I know my well yeah so it's fourth
generation though my my
so it was my dad's grandfather so I
guess my great great
not my great
grandfather Yeah would have been the
start I think Grandpa my dad and now my
cousins do it
and my dad when I was growing up
he would always say like
you know because
family business like what else am I
gonna do hey I'm gonna be a plumber like
I'm just gonna yeah I'm gonna take I'm
gonna take it over my dad would always
just say he'd be like I I want more for
you
there's more in this world yeah than
plumbing and like if you keep working
hard like I want you to have a life
where you don't have to do this yeah and
uh unbelievable yeah it's like your
sisters can do that yeah yeah you got
you got plenty of cousins dude it's like
who's gonna take it over and showing off
my cousins oh yeah my cousin Snapchat
one time that's beautiful I'm coming up
in 100 years at McAvoy Plumbing Heating
pretty sick yeah pretty wild uh all
right so we play a game on this show
that we're gonna put you through right
now it's called passion score okay I
love it what we're gonna do is gonna
give you three options
and you have to rank them essentially in
the ranking of what you like or what you
need the most to need the lease so like
pass it's good to Dish the puck around
but it's not our favorite shoot pucks on
that is amazing that's going to be your
middle one score is obviously the
ultimate goal so that's the one you like
the most yeah okay so you growing up you
have a lot of players that you emulated
Bob you are being one of them because
he's obviously the greatest defenseman
of all time now there's a connection
with the Bruins big Rangers Fan growing
up Brian Leach was a stud when you were
young so a big guy that you kind of
emulated your game off of and then as
you get to that next level and you're
looking at guys in the league
immediately Drew Doughty someone that
came up that you were like this guy has
a great game that I play so for sure so
if you have to pass shoot score doubter
leech and Bobby Orr what's the ranking
okay well and you can take this however
you want in terms of like the ones you
play like the most the ones that you
looked up to the most or however okay
um
okay so I'll go
I'll go pass first I guess so I'll go
pass with uh with Dowdy
um
outstanding defenseman yeah growing up
definitely I like
maybe not growing up so I think it was
more like once I'm
you know 13 14 15 like
you're getting to an age where you know
you're starting to know like you know
what your game looks like you know what
you want it to look like
um you know what you bring to like a a
team playing junior hockey at that point
so you're like climbing the ladder and
he was for sure the guy I'm like I want
to be just like him I want to play just
like him he was one of Norris trophies
Stanley Cups like
and he was awesome so he was that guy
for me uh
you know sort of when I was a little bit
older when I was
younger so I'll go score with Brian
Leach he was my hero when I was a kid uh
growing up he definitely had everything
to do with who I wanted to be as a
player I grew up watching that 94 road
to the Stanley Cup uh the year the
Rangers won yeah so like my mom tells it
like I would just every single day
to put it back in the VHS every day
Rangers every day Rangers we're gonna
watch Rangers
watch this [ __ ] every single day and he
he won the con Smite that year like so
many big plays
um
he was he was absolutely my hero and I'm
like I'm gonna be just like him yeah so
he's just by like playing defense like I
when I went back on D I'm like it's fine
because I'm going to be yeah yeah so it
didn't matter because he was my favorite
player anyway and he's a defenseman and
and
funny about that is uh
so
in Long Beach where I grew up uh Caitlyn
Pyle who is a girl like our families
grew up together we grew up together
went to school together
um
her mom's
sister were I think it's her mom's
sister married Brian Leach oh [ __ ] so I
was like where's those going so who
other than Brian Leach who spends like
you know a few weeks a year in Long
Beach yeah and I met him a bunch of
times wow I'm growing up and I'm like
this is insane like this guy is my hero
and I'd see him all the time and then
now I know him you know well I knew him
then but then I make it to the NHL now
I'm in Boston he lives in Boston his
wife Mary Beth great people and and I
see him all the time and like it's just
crazy how
small like that's insane yeah so he's in
Long Beach all the time not see him as a
kid so leech is your score so leech is
my score and then sorry leech is my
shoot yeah okay dude I was sorry I was
like wow so you're putting Bobby as the
number one Bobby's number one so it's so
wow
to make things simple it's Bobby one
which two Dowdy three yeah
Bobby Orr
is like I don't even know how to explain
this guy obviously best defense would
never play this game
um so I'm I'm a client with the word
group so I met him for the first time
back in
2015. it was at the draft in Fort
Lauderdale so I was already like an org
group client at that point you have an
advisor you have an agent because
whatever the rules rules yes uh legal
stuff yeah yeah yeah so you have an
advisor
um you know within the org group and and
I went there and met him for the first
time
Larger than Life this guy
he is
like I don't even know how to explain it
so obviously how much of a gentleman
um you know burgie and and ZR
that is that is Bobby he is one of the
best human beings I've ever met
he like the fact that I have a
relationship with him is like blows my
mind like I spoke to him on the phone
the other day some of the Winter Classic
like we we talk all the time called me a
bit over the summer
um he'll always drop me you know text
throughout the season and sometimes I
still pinch myself and I'm like okay
this this is the best defenseman to ever
play the game of hockey uh one of the
best players to ever play hockey in
general
um
and then the thing that sets them apart
from everybody is that is I don't know
if I've ever met anybody who is as good
a person as as Bobby Orr like out of
town dude he is unbelievable like they
say don't meet your Heroes like
he puts that to shape you can meet him
yes when I was about to say can we talk
about the fact that two of your personal
Heroes you have personal how creative
like I know you're just like this oh my
God Brian leech Bob you are two guys I
would love to have any sort of a career
like and just what unbelievable people
to live by yeah oh I'm from also we're
boys you should hang out with daddy he's
the Manitoba yeah
dude uh Bobby Orr once you stop playing
he used to get his hair cut at the same
place as our grandmother who was you
know like 90. yeah and he was so nice to
her and then we'd be like going to Bees
games and if he was there like around
the city like if four was across the
street or whatever yeah we'd see him and
he'd be like us hey Fran yeah like my
grandmother and I was like dude believe
it like out unbelievable like Larger
than Life man he he
has time for everyone and for for
someone of his stature and like
pedigree right like who he is to the
game of hockey
he carries himself in such a way
that
it really is mind-blowing like how how
he's able to do that because I'm sure
the stress is you know of Life of being
as famous as he is
it could could probably cause anybody to
you know to
maybe be Starkey or mean or anything
like you just you know you're tired of
all that never seen him I've never seen
him ever in that light like he's just
always on and and who he and like that
doesn't mean you're on that just is who
you are right if you if that if you
treat people like that every every day
like that's that's just who you are now
so Bobby he's a truly amazing person
yeah amazing yeah okay uh we know you're

I don't know whatever I do like playing
you know what you know what I have is I
still have an Xbox 360. and I play NCAA
14 the college football game dude one of
the best games ever it's because you're
so upsetting so I'm not like like as

my favorite college football team is
played an eight-year-old game they're my
favorite college football team is uh
Oklahoma State

like we don't have any college football
near us so my favorite color is orange
and that's just when you're a kid right
so I'm going through all the teams and
I'm like I'm gonna I got like it was
NCAA like oh wait on the Wii or
something for Christmas just saw an
orange team with an orange logo
would come out and they'd be like you'll
get the new game and I'd be like I just
have to see Mike Holt's career through
this guy that I made up this recruiting
class I got coming in is really good
dude I would customize their jerseys
everywhere uh the tint advisor on every
single player that's so then there was
that there there was that feature where
you could transfer your college players
yeah to men it always yeah yeah and that
personal connection I was like I never
did it yeah but I was always like this
guy and I recorded him I brought him up
I got a draft got to get this guy here
unbelievable uh okay so
that's so funny I'm glad you guys like
that game so it's the best and then I'm
gonna score
rocket powers that that is the best show
ever made my sister shout out Kayla she
got me it was on uh
Amazon Prime maybe like watch yeah yeah
so she bought me like the whole thing
the whole thing yeah all of it so yes
for Christmas like four years ago or
something and she's like here's the
login like whatever all the rock so I
went and watched like we would watch
them all together as like a family and
it was so freaking throwback man The
Nostalgia and then uh I haven't watched
them in a long time but I was right
there there's somewhere did it hold up
on that family rewatch were you like the
show is still off dude it's still
awesome it's still awesome and even and
even like
if it's not
like for what it was back then and what
it like meant like when we were kids I
mean like it's still so there's some
life lessons oh yeah I mean Uncle Tito
was a legend he's brilliant and I'm so
I'm a big Surfer as well yeah and like
growing up having a show on nickel oh my
god with like Surfer kids I was like
this is awesome my cousin my cousin was
over the house uh
for Winter Classic they were in town so
a few days ago and it was the first time
he met Otto so Otto's obviously we're
gonna talk his name after Auto rocket
um and he was like did you did you name
Otto after rocket power so my cousin
this is my Uncle Monkey Bobby he was in
the Air Force so he was in Hawaii for a
while
so he goes you're not going to believe
this but Tito so Uncle Tito the guy who
voiced him came and like spoke at his
school when he was growing up in Hawaii
I kid you not oh my God everyone in the
auditorium and you got Uncle Tito in
there like giving everybody come as like
and now the voice of Uncle Tito on
Rocket Power that's probably how they
introduced him no one would have known
him it's just some guy yeah yeah so I
was wondering like maybe he did
something else blew my mind he's like
bro Tito was in the auditorium with us
and we're not joking when I was in
school he came and talked to us ever
yeah that's amazing two type of
inspirational stuff yeah could he have
said like yeah well I mean with the sage
wisdom that Uncle Tito had on the show
oh he just brought some of that yeah
it's cool so now that we've brought up
Otto the Rocket Dog
are I have a bit of a gripe that Darla
forbert's dog is like the team dog like
is Otto pissed about this like I feel
like we need to get Auto more love oh
it's a healthy uh
it's good fuel for him to to get his
seat belt back up yeah be better no he's
I freaking love my dog man I was Kylie
wanted to get a dog she had family dogs
growing up I had a dog
um
when I was really young so like earliest
memories like I kind of remember
our dog and then the rest of my
childhood we didn't have one yeah so I
was kind of on like the whole I don't
want a dog and then you know she kind of
convinced me we got him during covid
like
I didn't realize how much
like you just fall in love with your dog
like I like I freaking do you come home
every single day that thing is so happy
to see me and he's anyway he's an
awesome dog too like we got really lucky
like he's really well tempered and
everything and he's abused oh he's great
and he's you can be a dash five and he's
like I love dude he doesn't care yeah
I'm home now the worst day of my life
and he like is gonna lick my face and
he's so excited he's like you are the
greatest person I've ever yes yes do the
emotional support you get from a dog I
freaking I get I miss him when I leave
I'm like head back home yeah have you
ever brought him on a road trip no no we
brought him uh
he had a sleepover at the hotel for the
Winter Classic because Kylie was
checking her oh sure yeah that's because
everybody was in town and uh my family
was staying at our place and she's like
I'm gonna bring him to the hotel so he
had a he had a little sleepover yeah
yeah Ritz dog
um we haven't really taken him anywhere
far I don't we haven't even tried to fly
with him I don't even know if he'd be
able to he's right on that like 30 pound
threshold or I don't know if you can oh
he could laugh dog him I mean oh that's
a good point but below the plane stuff
just like raps I was on my on my flight
back yesterday yeah I was walking
through JetBlue mint and there's this
woman sitting there in first class with
a full like a monster Labradoodle in her
lap really Jesus Christ
[Music]
they've all got the vests on now yeah
yeah yeah you're in the I mean I was on
that there was there was like five dogs
on that plane there's this one dude who
brought he had a little he had a little
Frenchie actually but this thing was
maybe two months old okay and this baby
baby yeah total baby like he still had
the rolls on his face and he brought him
back in his little bag and this poor guy
had just like [ __ ] everywhere is like a
puppy yeah of course yeah this dog is
just struggling that's a long flight for
a little baby long long fight all right
we got two more for you okay two more
pass shoot scores this one is one that
you from what I understand things you do
not like okay so past you'd score and
and yeah like the order of this is gonna
be same order but think about the ones
like score will be your worst like
Powers you can tolerate score is like
okay okay okay okay okay every day for a
year you have to eat avocado toast for
breakfast
next one you get home and there's a
guarantee that auto doesn't get eaten
but Kylie has bought a pet snake oh and
this thing has to live out of a cage
just slithering around your house
okay so it's just like you have a live
snake and I don't want a live snake I
wouldn't either and then the last one is
you have to become Tick-Tock famous and
post tick tock Dance videos as your side
hustle as your side Hustle damn
how could I how could I put that one
over the snake no but I might
I might put up with a [ __ ] snake so I
don't have to be taking I don't even
have tick-tocks at all of it these are
things that you hate
okay I like avocado toast I don't know
who gave you that Intel oh intro okay I
love a good option I learned once
somewhere that you you found avocado
overrated avocado it is overrated like
like charging extra for guac and [ __ ]
yeah but but avocado toast we're down
with yeah
I do hate because I like avocado jokes
too but I do hate Hudson
like hey can I have some toast like yeah
it's free and I'm like can you just
surprise some avocado and they're like
this yeah 20 bucks dude it was free
toast one second ago it was an avocado
all right well then that's an easy pass
yeah so you got an easy one all right I
like avocado toast
um
I I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it yes
yes I'm gonna shoot this I'm gonna shoot
the living with a snake yep
so I don't have to become Tick Tock fans
wow just you didn't say it was like a
cobra or anything though like no maybe
I'm just thinking like there oh no it's
nice well I did say there's no fear that
Otto gets eaten implying it is a large
snake it's a large like we're talking
about like Snakes on a Plane snake yeah
yeah oh yeah like there's like a boa in
your house oh just like slithering
around and it's like shedding and [ __ ]
oh yeah [ __ ] I still don't want to be
Tick-Tock famous so I love this answer
this is not what I was expecting at all
that I learned I would rather make his
Eaton Auto too no no no I'm telling you
there's a caveat of this scenario okay
never okay okay there's a world where
you actually become Tick-Tock famous
because Otto and the snake are such good
friends yeah like that's the loophole
here
unlikely animal Duos okay all right here
we go favorite win
of these three and we're not counting
the the World Junior Gold is not in this
because I know that would win okay pass
you score these three wins in your
career okay
game one 2019 Stanley Cup finals your
first cup game ever you score a sick
goal right on the power play yeah
that was sick second one bean pot
freshman year first game you score the
game your first ever bean pot you scored
a game-winner against Northeastern at
the Garden Place going insane yeah
number three
the Bell Capital Cup Final when the
gulls beat the beat the Syracuse stars
9-1 and you had a tuck yeah holy cow
through the Bell Capital Cup that was
such a Redemption that would be like
this time of year
um so it was always right after
Christmas uh I'm gonna Pat I'll pass the
Bell Capital Cup really yeah so that was
that was a blast
um it was always this time of year so
right after Christmas like you'd we'd
hit the road you go to Ottawa uh and all
the games were whatever at your local
youth rank in Ottawa but if you made it
to the final like so that Sunday all the
finals games were played at Scotiabank
which is now uh Canadian Tire yeah yeah
yeah so you speaks coachmenk uh so that
was the first time I ever played on NHL
ice and like it was it was sick and you
lost it the year before you absolutely
blew them out we lost in the semi-finals
to
we lost to them yeah I think or
yeah maybe it was we lost it before in
the semi-finals so we didn't make it to
the final that year and then yeah
because you had the NHL ice ripped from
you dude yeah you come back against the
stars and Pummel them to pump them I
know that was really cool what a good
memory that was thanks for taking me
down memories of course uh and then I'll
do the northeastern
um that was great that was my first time
playing at the Garden and that was
really cool the bean pot like
I didn't understand it because I didn't
like grow up with college hockey
um
just how important it is and how cool it
is there like it's unbelievable and like
everyone's there the student sections
are crazy like it it embodies what the
coolest part of college hockey is that's
one of our favorite things about college
hockey because growing up near there
yeah that was like an easy ticket for
our parents so it was like we went you
can go to the whole year yeah and it was
like dude that was like my dream as a
kid I was like I will like this is the
coolest thing I've ever seen and Charlie
I mean like we grew up in a little Beach
town in Southern Maine so like we had
UMaine UNH then all the Boston Schools
like we were surrounded oh yeah I call
it hockey so it was just like the bean
pod is huge dude [ __ ] bean pot I lost
the finals out there twice oh God over
time one nothing against BC Alex tuck
scored yep and then the next year was uh
Harvard right Harvard Harvard beat is
pretty good they were good they went to
the Frozen Four that year yeah they were
wagging that year they were good yeah so
I didn't get a bean pot and then I'll
score the Stanley Cup yeah yeah that was
sick
that was really cool man those memories
are so bittersweet because it's like
you're enjoying the ride and like I
obviously still remember everything so
vividly like
that roller coaster you win a game and
you're like I'm where am I taking the
Stanley Cup when we win like you lose a
game and it's just over and you're like
well I can't believe we did all this for
nothing like that's that's like the
roller coaster of emotions and like
maybe it's because I was younger so like
I have a little bit more experience now
different like perspective on it but I
remember like just how crazy every
single moment was like and that change
of emotions it was really cool it was
really neat
um obviously
hope I get a chance to do it again hell
yeah yeah and that's sports right like
one team yeah it's out of here yeah once
he went all that way for nothing yeah
been on that side so maybe you gotta
learn how to lose to exactly well listen

pretty good yeah I did guys this year

yeah what a Legend
um all right let's wrap up the episode
as we always do with some of our
favorite segments uh we're gonna do some
uh Quaker today we're doing quack attack
welcome back to the quack attack
everybody and um for the new listeners
every week we Dan and I rate the three
hottest teams in the league based on the
three Mighty Ducks movies uh the third
best team is the Eden Hall JV the uh
second best team is the Ducks one
District Five team and the first team is
the Goodwill games Ducks this week since
we've been gone we're gonna break a
little bit about our own rules and kind
of look at a wider stretch here it's not
just the last couple days because we
just felt like some teams were so hot
that they deserved credit for us being
away we didn't want to overlook them
we're gonna we're getting back into it
so we're gonna stretch it out uh our
third hottest team of the week is going
to be the Tampa Bay Lightning they're
10-3 in December uh 11 and 3 if you
count their win last night only losses
are to the Leafs and the Red Wings twice
and the Red Wings don't sleep on them
not being in the playoffs right now
because they're a wagon and they have
they're the most injured team in the
league right now so they are very good
they've ripped off five in a row
um you know they're up Toronto's ass for
that second place in the Atlantic
they're down four points but they have
two games in hand so you know the
sleeping giant is back the bolts started
slow and they are hot don't sleep on
Tampa do not the number two team in the
quack attack The District Five Mighty
Ducks is your Carolina Hurricanes nine
and one in their last ten Dan head 110
in a row before losing to the rags 5-3
last night actually and honestly man
they could be and possibly should be the
number one team this quack attack
session but I just really wanted to say
something for you particularly um but
they're the hottest team going man they
have caught and passed the Devils after
that super hot start from New Jersey and
everyone was going nuts about the Devils
they beat the Devils twice in this
stretch they've been on they have the
second most points in the league and
this team was a pre-season favorite and
they have it all the way figured out
right now yeah they sure do and our
number one hottest team in the league
right now is my Buffalo saber whoa would
you look at that everyone counted them
out after I called them a certified
wagon and ho-hum after a tough double
loss to the Penguins
they've won seven straight including a
massive OT win against the Boston Bruins
by the way first straight up OT loss for
the Bruins All Season they've lost in
the shootout but have not lost an OT but
they did they're getting monster
production from our boys Alex tuck and
my prince Tage Thompson who's [ __ ]
around and maybe gonna win MVP right now
but these guys are surging they are
sniffing
sniffing that wild card playoff spot
they are unbelievable right now they are
the highest scoring team in the league
over the Beast not gold diff but highest
scoring team they're starting to figure
it out they're coming into their own the
Buffalo Sabers are the hottest team in
the league incredible Emily please put
that sniffing on your only fans yeah oh
yeah yeah my ASMR only fans yeah it's
unbelievable um all right let's get into
some Michael watch Chris
okay here we're with Ikea watch uh Dan I
have a running bet we're trying to see I
said Jack eichel over 72 points was easy
money this year Dan disagreed and then
we're also on 90 point watch because Dan
might have to eat 90s from cocktail and
I gotta say for everybody it's
um it's sad well there's pros and cons
here so last time we checked in he had
29 Points in 27 games he still has 29
Points in 27 games because he was placed
on injured reserve yeah here's the thing
the one nice thing well Jack has done so
many nice things for me this year my
good friend Jack another nice thing he
did was go on IR while we were on break
like I never actually had to come on the
Pod you didn't really have to answer for
this she was being hurt which was always
the fear right it's almost like he knew
it is it's like he was aware so here's
the thing he missed two games he came
back played a game went pointless and
then they put him on ir and he missed
11th straight so Dan uh it is Wednesday
today yesterday Tuesday he was removed
from ir and is projected to play
tomorrow against Pitt which is great
news so he is back and I'm so happy and
we're rooting for him here's the
interesting thing with those 13 missed
games he's now assuming perfect health
will only play 69 games this season yeah
which means through a 69 Game season he
is currently on Pace for 74 points so
he's still hit I'm still safe in terms
of my bet yes now like kind of in the
middle there of like the nothing and I
will say this
in the name of content
the 72-point BET stands in the name of
content I would be willing to do some
sort of number crunch compromise
punishment yeah like if he if he
finishes the season with an amount of
points that is comparable to a 90-point
pace if you got a 90-point pace per
games played yes you will still do it I
will still do it okay I respect it in
the name of content thank you very
because I do love Jack like I said Yup
so but the 72 Point there's no loophole
because Andrews was a part of it I
needed to hit it and he's still on pace
so rooting for you jack yes and if
people remember the only reason I I said
72 wasn't a lock is because of injury
yeah I was like I'm not sure he's gonna
go 82 games and looks like he did not uh
all right our next segment where in the
world is Austin Matthews we've kind of
taken a break on this a little bit
because the the Leafs are firing they're
looking as good as ever they're second
in the Atlantic uh just a really solid
Squad getting a lot of production from
their top guys Austin being one of them
he's got 19 goals and 25 assists for 44
points in 38 games uh he has become
officially the fastest maple leaf ever
to hit 500 career points which is sick
the fact that he already has 500 career
points is laugh out loud stuff it just
speaks to how unbelievable he is uh like
we said the Leafs are in second place
however those bolts you know they got
two games in hand so it's not that
pretty it's not looking that good and
then the bigger one that I'd like to
point out is yet again the Toronto Maple
Leafs lost to a little old team in the
desert the dirty dogs the coyotes they
got [ __ ] pumped in fact yeah as they
always do and it begs the question I
don't know
coyotes sitting down there in last place
there's a little boy named Connor Bedard
who's lighting the world on fire looking
like he's got a ticket a one-way ticket
on a bullet train right to Arizona gonna
be chilling in Tempe
maybe Austin's saying might be fun to
play with him so while the Maple Leafs
are doing well Austin's doing well I
don't know I just think he's searching
right now I'm gonna put him in Montana
we're gonna put Austin in Big Sky right
now he's doing some skin he's enjoying
life in God's country and you know if
you kind of look straight down the
country from Montana there's what do you
see down there there's a little State
called Arizona it's right right there so
don't get too comfortable Leafs fans the
bolts are sniffing up your ass and you
still can't get past those dirty dogs
they just continue to get your goat so
Austin doing very well just like his
team but he's still searching still
searching that's all I'm saying I'm
happy about it that takes us right to
the playoff Trail Dan and listen we
already talked about Buffalo and the
quack attacks we don't have to code too
deep but I just did want to ask you you
know Tage is obviously doing his thing
but tuck is firing Skinner is firing
darling is firing you've seen the gold
diff up to plus 21 so they're taking
care of the puck in the d-zone they
could be real trouble here at this point
like they are they are
they are very very much in the mix for
wild card contention for the rest of the
season and I know you're all over the
stories and everything but you just got
to be feeling really validated I feel
fantastic dude it's I mean it's just I I
I never gave up I never wavered I'm I've
stuck by my guys and listen there might
be some rough pumpkins coming up here
for the the latter half of the season
and I'm gonna stand right by them the
whole time they're in one of those right
now where you stop the Oregon Trail
wagon and to hunt and this [ __ ]
Buffalo everywhere and yes you know like
the family is fed for the next month but
dysentery is around the corner dude yeah
and it always is that's the thing take
care of that meat this is this is what
has happened in in years past with the
Buffalo Sabers is they start hot and we
rest on our Laurels dude and the next
thing you know
we have dysentery yeah and we're done
we're dying in the streets we're getting
dumped in trenches so we're cruising a
lot that's not happening this time we're
staying sharp we know that there's we're
not perfect so we're gonna just keep
rolling here uh amazing stuff like I
said the wagon rolls on dude not too
fast not grueling speed no no speed
makes people we're a slow steady tempo
to the playoffs uh okay let's give
people some games to watch as we get out
of here okay my two games to watch I'm
going two Saturday tilts number one
Rangers Devils always love me a Rangers
Devils game just two great teams
I think they're both you know in a
similar spot in the playoffs but
battling really looking good right now
that's gonna be a fun one and then my
other one I always love this matchup for
whatever reason Kings Knights I think
King's Knights have a sort of unofficial
rivalry here it's always an electric

yeah my decision by the NTP came after
my first year playing juniors and suit
balls like trying to team my under 18
year and you know the guys really
brought me and made me feel like I was
one of the team and you know didn't make
me feel like I was a new guy I think
just the Brotherhood that comes from
playing from the
the relationship you build your team and
also the younger guys being so close
with them all the time and you know
especially happier roommate help with JT
green like nobody felt a good
Brotherhood there and meant the world to
me you know putting on a jersey that
says USA every single day going
international tournaments representing
your country is really something special
or really it's home and you know
something we always want to do your
whole entire life and as soon as you
throw meters the first time it really
means a lot
I'd say probably Switzerland trip it was
pretty good scored is there and I think
that was probably my favorite just
because you know we had a lot of fun
notes our first international tournament
of the under-18 here and just you know
we had a lot of fun with other teams as
well you know playing soccer was Sweden
you know before the tournament started
and also even climbing up I'm afraid of
heights so we climb about and that was
pretty scary for me and foxy I remember
us kind of freaking out on that mountain
I think that GP prepared me for college
hockey on the ice just with the you know
the way they want you to ensure and you
don't play the game in the right
professional matter and then off the ice
as well you know they they put a lot of
the you could say the pressure on you to
become a good adult and a good person
and to respect others and you know
really a big thing in college and you're
on your own

Dennis Cholowski,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybI0VPf4wDA,"expense
yeah we're gonna throw them wings of
love we show the league that this is our
time let's make the city probably go win
the Stanley Cup
after that we gonna party we go show
everybody we shall
Oh
what's up Red Wings fans I'm Carly
Johnson and welcome to coffee with Carly
presented by Tim Hortons quarantine
style this time we have none other than
Dennis to louse keep with us today
Dennis how's it going it's going great
how are you I'm good just trying to stay
healthy and stay sane while staying
inside
interesting times definitely no kidding
so where are you at right now
Omaha Nebraska had my girlfriend's
childhood home oh wow what are you doing
there
opener pack all her stuff up and move
out to my place in Detroit awesome
speaking of childhood homes you grew up
in British Columbia what was life like
for young Dennis it was fun
no my family's already been you know
I've always been big supporters of me
and still are you know growing up there
hockey was the number one thing for
everybody all my friends played it of
course I played it that's that's
obviously the big sport around there so
yeah I had a lot of fun growing up I
played hockey since I was three four
years old and no thankfully it's turned
out okay so far speaking of hockey let's
talk about your path to where you are
today you were drafted by the Red Wings
in the first round in 2016 what was it
like hearing your name called by an
original 16 oh and something you'll
never forget you know you can only get
drafted one offensive to be drafted by
an original 16 the history that Detroit
has is something special for sure you
know sitting there was just
nerve-racking and I guess it was sight
each other is waiting hoping my name
would be called that day and thankfully
it did it's something I'll never forget
and then in 2018 in October you made the
opening night roster out of training
camp which is incredible making your NHL
season debut in front of a home crowd
Caeser Serena I remember I was there
what was it like to play with a big meal
on your sweater oh it was so cool you
know you grow up watching the NHL and
watching guys you know put on the Jersey
yeah that was a special night my whole
family was there it was a cool moment
but not only did you make your NHL
career paper you also scored your first
NHL goal we were just completely on
cloud nine I mean what was going through
your head in that day well yeah I was
already on cloud nine the fact that I
made the opening night roster and you
know when I scored the goal I I don't
even remember the rest of the game it
was the coolest moment and that that's
right now at least right now that's my
number one moment you know that I've
experienced that's incredible and how
are you enjoying living in Michigan
you've been on both ends in Detroit and
in Grand Rapids yeah I like it a lot
Michigan's been great to me so far and
you know I have a nice place in Detroit
obviously Grand Rapids is really nice
too
being able to play some games there and
getting to know all the guys has been
great Detroit is one of the premier
organizations in the league so to be
able to play for them and put that
Jersey on every night is pretty cool I
heard you're a bit of a sneaker head uh
have you always been him back to a dude
with shoes what guy you started yeah
definitely always been infatuated with
shoes but I didn't really get into it
until my first year in Detroit my
girlfriend introduced me to the Kanye
West shoe the easies and I got into
those a little bit and I started doing
my research and got into Jordans and it
really just took off from there and and
I have way too many pairs of shoes and
now it's it's probably not healthy but I
do cherish the collection all right if
you had to estimate how many pairs of
sneakers do you think you have I had to
estimate I would estimate around 70 to
75 pairs and I keep them all upstairs in
my closet and I will be honest they've
kind of taken up most of the room in the
closet and my girlfriend is not overly
happy with that but I might have to find
a different place for them so we'll try
to make it work do you have a favorite
pair I don't know I have a pair of a
retro
Oh Jordan 1 Chicago Jordan ones kind of
the ones he wore back in 1985 obviously
they've been remodeled and I'll have an
original 1985 pair but yeah I would say
I cherish those the most I warm once and
and I just can't risk getting a scuffle
on them so they've been sitting on the
Shelf ever since it for you just buy
these shoes and you wear them once and
then you just keep them to look at well
I try to wear them all in rotation I
don't wear the same pair twice and then
kind of really rotate from there and
gonna base my outfits around a little I
guess awesome that's great is there
anything that I didn't ask about that we
should know about or that you want to
talk about message right now is just
stay quarantined and stay safe and pass
that along
everybody else and you know this is
interesting times for everybody and you
know hopefully we can all get through
this and it'll get back to playing as
soon as we can love it well thank you so
much for being on coffee with Carly send
us you really appreciate it stay healthy
and stay happy I can't wait to see you
back on the ice yeah thank you for
having me thanks for tuning in hockey
town that was coffee with Carly
presented by Tim Hortons

Julien Gauthier,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iClkuNVJmDw,"kind of a slow start to that one but you
guys seem to find your life there in the
second half
i mean yeah like obviously not the star
we wanted we kind of let them play a
little bit too much for uh for what we
wanted but you know the response was
great from our group and
i think you know putting pressure on
their d and everything was working out
for us and you know we had a good game
did you turn into playmaker instead
i mean like uh you know i had some got a
good opportunity to make a pass today
and it just happened to work out so keep
going on that
the play that you make i mean there's
not too many guys that can
get a couple feet off the ice great kind
of hoping that someone was going to come
on to that one
i mean i mean you know like you work you
work every day on your tips or like your
ability and stuff like that you know you
never know when it's going to pay off
but like you know that i've been really
consistent in my work you know on and
off the ice every day just working hard
and you know sometimes it pays off and
you know i'm using my speed into my
advantage and
it showed tonight
on that one yeah absolutely yeah
yeah
julie you've talked before about wanting
to get an opportunity and what your role
was do you think that this is just a
matter of you getting the opportunity
and taking an advantage or do you think
something has changed for the better in
your game
i mean like you know like if we talk
about my game you know every day as i
said you know i work on my game you know
it's like an everyday thing for me i
really try to be better you know you
like if you want to stay in that league
you got to be better and try to get
better every day that's the only way you
know like to be a good player and also
you know just the opportunity like i've
been playing more you know i feel more
confident with the pucks on the ice and
just you know everything is kind of like
falling into piece for me so just like i
mean just keep it going honestly that
that top do you feel that right now does
it make everything feel smoother for you
on the ice yeah more and more you know i
feel like my coach is giving me like a
more trust you know like he's trusting
me more and
you know it's like mutual thing you know
it helps and you know i'm happy that
like it paid off tonight well you were
exposed
to that
after the way last season ended and
obviously changing cultures and
administrations but were you
happy that you were not selected you
know did you have mixed feelings about
it
uh of course i like new york you know
i'd like to stay here you know i'm happy
i stay there but like it's something i
have like absolutely zero control on it
so you know like i don't want to really
answer hypothetical you know just every
day you know i come to work in new york
and i'm really happy to be here
how are you feeling you guys i don't
know how many games in a row but with
you playing consistently now with alexi
and with phil like how is that coming
along for you guys uh really well i feel
and you know like it's fun that you know
what your line is going to be next game
so you know you you never know 100 but
you know like the habits and stuff we
start to work on stuff for us three in
practice and it's kind of like it's
showing more you know our overall play
as like a line is getting better
we're starting to read off each other
and you know i think we've got some some
great opportunity again tonight and it's
been like a couple games going well so
we just got to keep it going it's going
to get better and better"

Max Jones,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTqMAZx1GoE,"oh
whose glasses are those
hey we can't hear you
who's are these glasses
I don't know that's fantastic
it's because they're prescription Max
that's how that works you see me through
the lens
well
for all I miss Veronica Corningstone
couldn't make it today
are you my host I'm your host no way I'm
your host who am I then
um
wait I guess you said you're not okay
I'm I'm uh Brooke Tamlin
whammy all right
so I have to start off by saying
welcome to dutchstream
thank you I'm your host for for this
event
um suggesting
laughs
we are here joined with Troy Terry after
signing seven years at what was it just
about league minimum somewhere on there
Troy thank you for being here how you
doing
oh I'm good I'm happy to be back I was
with I was with you Mr host last week
and
so I gotta go on a golf trip and then I
gotta go to Toronto and that was quite
the experience and now I got to be back
home with the family so it's it's been a
whirlwind but we're doing great
talking to you like I'm talking to like
a reporter well you are I'm interviewing
you I know you have to answer this like
but then I'm like we're friends so I
need to just talk to you
I we will we will get to the Casual talk
after I
get through these
I wrote it all down
um
how long are you in Toronto for
um about 24 hours on the DOT really
oh you got it done before anything
happened which is nice how'd that feel
good
it was good it was a little more
stressful than I thought it would be
um just the whole experience I didn't
really know what to expect there was a
lot of people there for the hearing
which I didn't expect
um and obviously I think
I mean I knew both sides wanted to get
something done and I didn't think we'd
end up there but
um it was
it was uh quite the experience but glad
everything worked out
so you got into the room and you saw
like everyone there or you got it done
before well just like uh just I mean
everyone was there because if we if we
ended up doing the hearing they were
ready so I met everyone and
um everyone was there kind of just
waiting for us to to
get a deal done and or else go into the
hearing but I mean it was pretty obvious
that we were going to get a deal done
but all these people still had to just
wait on us yeah yeah and you know before
that you were at that golf tournament
you said that must have been fun how was
that was that did you win
it was
um it was run okay there I had some
suggestions on how it could have been
ran
but
I had a great time
um it was
it's no Colorado but I love Michigan and
I love Northern Michigan and I got to
see my good friends
um and I wish I could have played better
golf
um one of the few people
Cam's what please don't interrupt me
Kansas
cam cam is one of the few people that I
get extremely nervous to play golf
around it's usually Cam and Cameron gets
here the two and me and you have had
rounds with them and I don't think I hit
a good shot either time
um but cam was my partner I just felt a
little too much pressure
but
um it was good he's gonna be so choked
that you just said that too it's gonna
be hilarious
I think I apologize to cam
618 times over everything however many
however many shots I took Strokes I had
on the weekends how many times I
apologize even if it was good and I
think
you ended up sticking a three wood to
about five feet that was a great shot
but what'd you do after
thank you for bringing that up I hit the
best golf shot of my life
I had
a lot of yards out I don't remember the
number it's like I hit I hit my hybrid
and I had a would you say eight or nine
foot putt for even I think it was like
probably like six feet
so it was about my height
and I you're not gonna leave an eagle
plot short and this was probably a TSN
turning point of the whole tournament
for me and Cam and I managed to blow the
pot
probably I had a longer birdie putt than
I had eagle
and then I proceeded to par and
apologized to cam 12 times before the
next T yeah that was you know
frustrating to see but you know what
it's fine because moving forward you
went to the Toronto and you got a deal
done and here you are now Troy thanks
again so much for being here you're such
a busy man
hard to get a hold of you I just want to
thank you so much and my next question
to you is I just want to know what
what's the team meal gonna be what's
that gonna be like where is it gonna be
what kind of food are we gonna be having
what do we think in here
um
you haven't thought about it yet have
you
I would have
I think
the thing is the thing is everyone has
places to go and like you know the
I shouldn't say the fun cities because
all the cities are fun and I want to
upset any cities but there are certain
cities where
um it just feels like the best time to
you know kind of have everyone get
together so I think
I think I might do it in like uh
a San Jose this year hmm
um and I was thinking maybe Italian for
everyone yeah okay and here's that
that's happening now that we've talked
about it yeah it certainly is Danny's in
the room too and she's shaking her head
she didn't know about she didn't know
that that was something that has to
happen but uh you'll be surprised I
think you're okay for it
Troy thank you again so much for being
here I just I can't thank you so much
you're like thank you
um
these glasses are great Troy thank you
for giving me to them or giving them to
me
unless you wrote that
Troy
he flew back from Toronto did you bring
any presents for us
[Music]
from Toronto for you specifically just
anyone on our team
[Laughter]
um
I mean it's okay it's enough I'll be
here thank you again thank you again so
much for being here thank you so much I
don't know if my presence on the team is
viewed as a present or
where guys are not so happy about it but
I I've been seven years is pretty pretty
cool it's pretty cool you're the
president you're the president that's
not what I was trying to say I just I
didn't know what other way to go with
that question because I didn't bring any
presents particularly
um but I wore the best suit I had
really
state liberty fit me like a glove did it
sure did I think that's why we got it I
think that's
a little lag am I lagging
you're great on my screen oh all I said
was I think the the suit I wore might
have been a contributing factor to me
getting a deal done absolutely and you
probably looked really muscular in it
too you said it fit like a glove
it did well I didn't before but I've
yeah fit if it could fit real good huh
Troy I see that you're wearing an aloe
hat um
is that a new hat
I'm not laughing at you Danny said
something funny
um it is an aloe hat it is I would say
it's about two or three weeks
so it's it's newer um
Danny Terry got it for me she said I
would look good in it and turns out I do
that's Troy thank you so much again for
being here I can't thank you enough
you're so busy
thank you so much and that brings me
another question your son Grayson will
be about what about about eight years
old maybe at what the time your deal is
done
something like that right
okay so now that you got your new aloe
hat I'm wondering will your Valentino
hat get passed down Grayson
also a hat that Danny's laughing at
something I said that's what I said no
Grayson said something funny
but
um I mean I think that's a generational
hat
I just I feel that
if anything I own I could be passed down
through the generations it would be that
that's a generational hat I mean I even
wrote on here I said will your Valentino
hat get passed out to him and will you
be getting a new one you did already get
a new hat I see it on your head right
now yeah but this is like my casual talk
to my showings on the Dutch stream
you know just casual yeah casual thank
you again Troy so much for being here
Troy Terry thank you so much
um
birthday gift also
you got this for me
I don't know if you got it for me or
Danny got it for me but you got this for
me
for my birthday
that was all me
Danny's help
and I'm just curious what's what's my
birthday present gonna be this year now
I'm just curious
is it gonna be some like do you like
that
Dak Prescott and and Ezekiel Elliott
kind of you know duffel bag types now is
that the kind of level that we're on
because I gave you a hat that had me in
it all right I pictured that had me in
it yeah I'll take a hat I'll actually
take a hat with a picture of you on it
if that's what you're talking about I
think I I think I might just take that
picture and every year for your birthday
just give you a new item with it on it
yeah yeah
okay I like that
I feel like you're going somewhere with
that nope nowhere I got no more
questions on here
and now we could just casually talk
okay I see that Grayson came to the ring
today
he did
um first
yeah I'll bring him on stream
nothing nothing you can say to me that
you wouldn't say to my son
Troy thank you so much for being here
Grayson thank you so much for being here
with your camera
look at the camera
oh I mean let me get a good look at him
very good how do I there we go that's
Uncle Max
that's me Grayson
that's Uncle Max really small through my
glasses through Troy I'm wearing Troy's
glasses
um what a little cutie
yeah what else should we talk about I
don't know did you skate around with him
was he oh yeah today
um yeah it was the first time he's
is seeing his old man on the ice sheet
um whoa
did you see that
put the camera moving around yeah yeah I
know I saw that I thought I was like a
faint for a second I thought it was me I
mean you can see both my hands I didn't
do that that was crazy yeah that was I
thought I was passing out from looking
through your glasses
uh but yeah he uh he came and then
I uh got to bring him on the ice I put
him up like this he likes he likes to do
the airplane
do the ear embarrassing me through the
airplane
so I took him around the airplane around
the ice I said here's the hockey net
here's the blue line
here's the red line do you think he'll
be a hockey player will you bring him
into hockey
I think so I think
I'd be shocked if he's not a golfer his
name is Grayson and that's a big golf
brand so we're banking on golf
but I will support whatever this little
guy would like to do so don't put him in
a box Max I'm not putting anybody in any
boxes
um when did you get home
um I got home at
eight o'clock Mountain Standard Time
okay yeah it was uh the like the hearing
the hearing started it was supposed to
start at nine and then
can you spit up on me
what's sweat on my head am I drooling
um but yeah he uh
no I said he we uh got the deal done it
like
I don't know noon there or so so it was
kind of a process and then
um went to lunch in beautiful Toronto
and then got on an airplane
we had a couple couple beverages
I had a few beers I felt like it was an
appropriate time to have some beers hey
I saw a picture of you at uh was at
lunch yeah it was the lunch after you
signed grood sent me it sent it to me it
was a picture of you with the two beers
oh yeah good for you so grudz is um
agent is with Kurt yeah yeah and I had
never met him before and and grooves was
on the Tee Box and he wouldn't leave him
alone on the phone and he like
he mentioned me to get off the phone and
then he just like hung up basically and
then I had to tell him that I don't know
him at all
um but then I ended up meeting his agent
and yeah his agent I think I was double
fisting
I think I was drinking Peyronie's at the
time that was probably 20 minutes after
the deal was signed oh man that's what
you were if I sell juice huh
I was pretty happy yeah I mean that's
the greatest thing ever right there
he's spitting up on me again yeah next
next to Grayson spit on you
um but yeah it was pretty awesome
um would have been cool if it would have
happened when we were together last week
oh I know that would have been insane
when's our Fantasy Draft also I don't
know I've been kind of I
should we ask him should ask him about
it or do you think that kind of stressed
them out like Hey when's that
I can see that stressing him out yeah
like he's got to go through all that and
set it all out I don't know he took a
lot of pride in being commissioner and
I mean that's not really challenging and
I think you'd be fine but whenever
anyone has anything to say about how the
league is run
he does not take kindly to that no which
I understand he puts a lot of effort in
I'm sure he'll see this stream I hope he
knows I appreciate it cam I'm looking at
you Pam we love you you're a great
commissioner
what you do is not unnoticed I'm sorry
for how many times I said sorry last
week for bad golf shots yep Troy thank
you for being here again got in there
once and once more and once or twice and
we love you as commissioner thank you
for Max this has been a lovely evening
but I said that like I'm getting off I'm
not trying to get off I'm just
it was an absolute pleasure to see your
face yeah thank you I was hoping I did
you see Mr J or did it say Mr Jones when
I joined it said MJ
it did
like Michael Jordan but I knew that that
had to be Max Jones because I didn't
think I was getting Michael Jordan on
the Stream
who knows and what could have been him
out of the realm of possibility but you
just seemed more likely yeah yeah that's
true I should have I should have known I
should have put in a different name
um let's talk about you are you when did
you get in
yesterday at about 10 30.
got in I came back to the house Alexis
set up like a big like security thing
now here it's like there's like a camera
like an alarm system so like I walked
into the house and the thing just starts
beeping and it's like enter passcode I
didn't know what the passcode was and
I'm like fumbling everything should I
grabbed my phone and the thing starts
going like I'm like
this is my place and I'm like calling
him like I I don't know what this code
is what's this code she's like it's okay
you just calm down I'm like I don't
there's buttons
what's the code she's like it's just
it's just tough Dakota animation I typed
the code in and it's fine and I was just
like
so that was fun are you um are you
someone
like when you got in yesterday at what
point did you take all of the clothes
that you brought with you and hang them
in your closet it's so funny you just
said that because
[Laughter]
oh that's good stuff yeah I mean are you
are you guys having problems are you
sleeping on the couch or what's going on
no no I just I haven't
that is
because honestly it's it to me it seems
like you're creating more work opening
it and then having here yes and then
you're gonna have to repack it to just
bring it upstairs I know
I know and I brought my little suitcase
upstairs and I unpacked that one and
then I was kind of like sitting here
while I was playing Xbox I was like kind
of taking my golf stuff out I'm like all
right that's gonna go in the closet and
I was thinking I'm like I'll just carry
each thing up entirely but I don't yeah
I don't think that's smart so I love
that you said that too because that that
is me is when we get somewhere
the first piece of luggage that I make
sure is where it needs to be is my golf
bag
you put your bag in the closet I get
home my clothes will be I won't have my
clothes on for months but the golf bag
goes right into where it's supposed to
be so I know it's safe and no one can
touch it yeah unless it's a hotel then
all you do is just put all your stuff on
the bed and sleep with it all on your
bed right
I was talking about I do I don't do that
at home I in Toronto well so in Toronto
I had I had dual beds but they're all
right so you put all your stuff on the
other bed so I just utilized the other
bed as my closet and I still had a bed
that was open for sleeping and for
reference I think it was mentioned the
last stream this got brought up
but I did have an issue with being on
the road with Max and my all of my
belongings would end up on my bed I
would then have to sleep on the bed
and a lot of times the belongings
wouldn't I wouldn't really take them off
I would just sleep there and if they got
knocked off they got knocked off it just
turned into like a great
a great you know thing for us I'd start
putting like the office chair on your
bed lamps and stuff and oh that's good
well how long was that now six years ago
now
when we were roommates we were roommates
for that one year right now maybe we
were roommates for we were made for like
that half of the year right rookie year
and then the year after well we were
kind of like up and down together
roommates and then the next year like
full year roommates and then
you signed it yeah are we veterans now
I don't know I I think I'm still
considered a young guy I think I mean
Trevor makes me feel like a veteran
that's for sure yeah yeah
yeah
okay yeah
I was that that makes sense no it does
definitely I mean then you start talking
about Jimmy and then Mac T like
definitely I feel yeah
you make me laugh
would it be better if I was back here
it might I just wish I had like thank
you so much for being here
just wish I had my glasses so I could
see you back there these ones I need
those things yeah did you give reference
on that that we had a golf trip and I
forgot my glasses and you ended up with
them yeah Troy left his glasses in the
Sprinter van that we rented and I took
them and he told me to bring them down
here and he'll get him when he gets here
so here they are
sure but I think that explains you as a
friend
you're loyal people when I need you to
you you do other things you know
you make me laugh that's cool
yeah you're uh
yeah thanks
[Laughter]
we uh we're going to dinner tonight to
celebrate so oh yes
yeah where are you going Eloise
um Shanahan's Brennan Shanahan's
uh no I I don't know how to continue off
that but that was a good one but we are
going to Shanahan's it's a steakhouse
I'll probably get a steak
really um
maybe a cocktail I don't know I don't
know what what should I go with tonight
I feel like an old-fashioned is always a
good start maybe an espresso martini
okay yeah I don't know
I think I'll probably start with an
old-fashioned I'm feeling like
yeah
I have the big ice cubes
that's a that's a must
I got one of those things in my uh
freezer here
yeah you make your own
yeah you make your own old fashions
I mean I don't do I don't know that I've
ever done it but I got the ice machine
that can make the ice
I just need to get the other ingredients
okay well that's a start yeah I've just
been waiting for something to celebrate
to do it so
yeah there you go
um I think it's almost Grayson's bedtime
should we say goodnight to him before
bed
uh what time is it there 7 40.

thinking about you

new car

send me a send me a picture of it or
something I want to see it what color is
it white it's
this is gonna surprise you
it is Royal British green
it's like a cool
it's it's like a dark green Royal
British sounds pretty cool yeah that's
why I threw that in there it stands
greenish it's like greenish gray I would
say oh we got yawns from the little guy
yeah um it's uh we were told that like
collectors and stuff like
they like the cut because that's like uh
Range Rover is am I getting the country
totally wrong it is British right
I don't know
I'm not a veterinarian I don't know my
country me neither I'm definitely not a
dog
um
that was a bad joke hopefully no I don't
understand I hope people understand that
I was joking uh sometimes we're on our
own little wavelength here and I laughed
I know I love that you followed me up on
that
um but like car collectors appreciate
the green and it makes it more valuable
apparently is what I've been told
because that's like the home color and
it's their official color oh
okay yep yeah but
um how about uh how about this I'll tell
a story on on the stream that I'm sure
people will appreciate because I still
have a few dings in my car
that I haven't gotten fixed
but what just for reference
um I showed up to an Anaheim Ducks game
against the Carolina Hurricanes and I am
listening to my
I'm listening to I think I listened to
Nickelback the whole way there I'm
needless to say I am extremely ready to
play in the National Hockey League and I
am driving down the ramp at Honda Center
and the Carolina Hurricanes bus is
driving up the ramp as I'm driving down
and
then the bus driver thought that he had
enough space to to clear me on the
outside which there was not and I ended
up getting my car hit by the Carolina
Hurricanes bus about two hours before a
National Hockey League match and then
had to swallow that and just just bury
it down inside me and like Jay like I
think it was Jalen Chatfield defenseman
for the Hurricanes he was standing up
there and he saw the whole thing and
he's like
did our bus driver just hit your car
like yeah
four guys on the team on the ice were
like man I heard about your car like yep
but we're playing a hockey match so I'm
gonna I'm gonna bury that right now
don't do that
you don't like when I mess around with
your glasses like that you can you see
what it looks like in your little thing
yeah I can see it right down
you're better looking when I can't see
your whole face though that's for sure
does that look that's about the same
isn't it it looks like a Snapchat filter
can we get our guy to screenshot that a
picture of that yeah that's that's going
to be all over now but now since we we
continued just on for me telling a story
with nothing cut in between it was all
fluid to this point
um is this where we say our goodbyes
yeah that sounds good to me
Alexa's gonna be home any minute I'm
gonna have to tell her that this was the
greatest probably interview I think I've
ever shot
so you know how'd the interview go I'm
gonna be like yeah that's good nothing
was cut everything was good fluid
straight through it was pretty quick
about a minute or two on and off
we had to bury things
deep down yeah
oh man No One's Gonna understand that
joke because of the things clipped we're
seeing funny things that aren't true
especially that especially that I'm sure
Terry
um so I think we say our goodbyes I go
to dinner with my wife I tell you you're
the host but I'm telling you how this is
going to go I'm going to tell you that I
appreciate you doing this with me it was
fun thank you for having my glasses and
I like you as a friend a person and a
teammate
Troy again for the tenth time maybe even
12th 13th I don't know thank you
just thank you so much for being here
this is so great so great and
you enjoyed dinner
there's a good thing they didn't tell me
you were the host before I would have I
don't know if I would have logged on you
wouldn't now we're saying mean things
that aren't true and I we don't mean
especially that it's okay it's the
banter and I'm usually the production
just don't leave me out
but
um yeah I like you
um
you know that's this is a time for you
to say nice things about me you don't
have to no I was gonna but now you are
forcing me to say it I was gonna come in
and just be like all jokes aside but now
I feel like I have to make jokes because
you just said that I have to say nice
things about you but I'm just gonna I'm
gonna go shout out to the side and I'm
actually saying nice things so anyways
Troy

okay you're still talking"
Riley Tufte,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0zxf_uhesQ,"yeah feeling really good
um you know it's gonna be a big series
big matchup for us it's been a battle
all season with Milwaukee that's who our
second round opponent is and we'll go
there for two and hopefully uh come out
with two but you never know what's going
to happen they're a good team and uh
we're gonna be ready to play yeah
yeah Evelyn how's it how do you guys
feel traveling how do you guys keep
focused how do you guys stay that you
know 100 pumped up yeah it's uh you know
we've had a week about a week and a half
off now
um because of you know we we took care
of business in the first round so
um pretty quick we didn't go to we went
to game three so it ended pretty quick
and as far as like travel and stuff um
you know just staying with your
nutrition and staying hydrated I guess
is the biggest thing when you're
traveling and you know we're going two
days early so that's it's gonna be good
we're gonna get our sleep and get our
rest so we'll be ready to go
uh pretty prepared for this game one
yeah yeah really prepared like I said
we've had a week and a half now to to
kind of prepare and get our heads right
and uh get our our rest so I think
everybody's
um you know looking forward to playing
Friday
um not gonna say we're sick and sick of
practicing but uh we're ready to play a
game so what do you guys know about
Milwaukee from the season series and how
close it was and how have you been able
to simulate some of the things you might
might have to watch out for when you get
up there yeah uh you know like I said
they're a great team you know everything
that they do
um
you know it's a good matchup for us I
think
um you know they got a good good lineup
up and down they have four lines they
can play and we have four lines that can
play as well
um
you know all defense we can play in
every situation so
um you know it's going to be a battle
everybody knows that but um you know as
long as we we stick to our structure and
we'll win our battles and stuff I think
uh we're gonna be fine
you guys had a long rest before the
first round series another long rest
before the second round how huge is that
this time of year to be able to heal up
from some of the bumps and bruises yeah
for sure
um you know like they said when it's
playoffs it ramps up a bit um for sure
um you know I think everybody's well
rested now
um
a couple injuries but um you know as far
as everybody else it's it's
um you know we're ready to go and uh
we're healthy so
um you're saying like the intensity
definitely goes up during the playoffs
um what kind of things are you guys
doing just to kind of prepare yourselves
for you know
[Applause]
it gets me I'm it's still very new to me
uh what kind of things are you guys
doing to prepare yourselves for this
kind of like more of intense of a
playoff
yeah I mean I just think
um you know we have a certain way that
we play We like to get hard on the four
check and you know kind of grind teams
down that way uh winning Puck battles
and
um I mean no that's it's basically all
there is to it is just winning battles
and how we prepare like that we would go
hard on each other in practice and uh
we're working hard every day so we're
ready for the game time and
um you know we've had you know like I
said A week and a half now so we've been
kind of beating each other up in
practice a little bit so it's going to
help us for the game
keys to Victory I just say stick into
our structure
um you know I'll stick into our identity
and playing the way that we have been
recently so
um you know if I could put in the words
that's uh winning Puck battles and
everybody doing their job everybody has
a certain job on the team just knowing
your role and you know it's going to be
fun
we look forward to any matchups against
Milwaukee any certain player that you
just kind of wanted to go back
uh no I mean I think they're all pretty
physical they're a heavy team they got
some new bodies new big guys in their
team and my line especially we're a big
line so we're looking forward to
matching up against those guys and you
know we've had some some good battles
during the season so we'll see who takes
this one"
Tage Thompson,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAiloMBYffw,"first NHL All-Star game what were your
thoughts when you found out I was uh
very excited obviously and
um that's something you dream of growing
up uh be a selected to that so to um to
hear my name for that is a rewarding
feeling
you saw the video with Don and Kevin
just when they told you what were you
feeling in those moments I mean you
seemed very excited
yeah it was just like like you said
exciting
um
I don't think there's really any other
way to put it it's uh something that I
think a lot of people work towards and
something I've been working towards
um and to be able to get rewarded with
that is uh it's a good feeling do you do
some reflecting I mean
I think back on what you've been through
and to get to this point yeah I mean
it's been a tough Journey tough road and
uh definitely faced a lot of adversity
along the way so
um I think it just makes you grateful
for where you're at in your career now
and
um just does it it makes you uh you know
not want to take things like this for
granted so it's just something I'm going
to be able to enjoy and
um you know
something that I've worked for so it's
going to be a rewarding feeling like I
said Congress was done we ain't got to
go last year for the first time ever you
had a chance to talk to him about his
first experience with it uh not not too
much yet I'll probably pick his brain a
little more
um you know as as we get closer maybe
um and obviously hopefully hopefully
he's joining me there so it'd be nice to
have him have him there with me I think
he deserves it so
um you know hopefully the fans vote in
the moon
to the skills competition events I
haven't thought about any of that yet so
get some help from the teammates here
maybe after practice work on a few
things and maybe get their opinion on
some stuff
you said hopefully Rasmus is there with
you what what do you think makes him
deserving well I mean I think you look
at his season he's he's dominant but the
numbers he's putting up and just how he
he takes over games and just the impact
he's had
um I mean he plays in every situation
for us and he's logging huge minutes and
um I think you know his his stats and
his results shell
um you know obviously how well he's been
playing and I think he's obviously very
deserving obviously he went last year
and
um just playing even better this year so
thank you"

Lucas Johansen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlsaxxGSLOs,"so how was day one it's good it was
pretty tough they work just pretty good
but you know it's it's important time
now to get ready for the season so when
one any other way doesn't feel like just
another practice or it's day one always
a little different a little more energy
yeah me everybody wants to set a good
first impression so maybe you know you I
don't wanna say you give a little extra
when there would be a do in a way in
terms of like maybe staying on after
extra and trying to show that you know
you want to be here and you want to have
a role here so I think most guys are in
the same boat when it comes to that what
do they tell you sending you down they
wanted me to get used to the program
they wanted me to to learn some things
and you know we went over what I should
be getting better at and you know I
think it's it's it's about your attitude
when you get sent down obviously I'm not
you know you're not excited about it but
you know in a way you got to find a way
to to get up and and you know you can't
waste a week where you're down and you
know so I think it's important to have a
good attitude I have a good attitude
about and I'm just going to do what they
ask
that's good I mean I didn't play I
it was obviously nice to learn their
systems and stuff and just see how they
operate and get a little sense of the
pro life I think you know that's what I
want us here to get to get prepared dark
to get us prepared for for the future so
yeah it took as much as I could from
well one thing we did say in the meeting
was the three and threes are pretty
tough and that's some you know I have
done in the in the Junior League but it
looks like it's on a new level here so
I'm looking forward to seeing how it is
I'll probably have a better answer for
you after a few games I don't know how
much talking about how crazy
the division was set up last year and
how came down to the wire teams that
were the best teams in the conference
didn't make the playoffs what are you
expecting from such a tough division
every single game really matters for you
guys
especially in Division ya know that I
mean that's kind of exciting you don't
want it to be you know uneven you want
you want everybody to be competitive and
I think you know that helps everybody
get prepared for their ultimate goal to
play in the NHL it's obviously both
leagues are very competitive so yeah
it's exciting when you say they set you
down and told you what they want you to
work on specifically that end of things
yeah they want me to find my offensive
game at a pro level they want to be able
to you know have me contribute from the
back end and be a factor offensively
they want me to just pretty much all get
used to a pro game get get used to what
I've always done
but just you know want a little faster
little you know bigger guys and so forth
if you have to explain to Bears fans
what your game is kind of based around
how I'd say I'm a fish and skater who
can join or lead to Rush positionally
sound you know Epoque move and
defenseman that can I can operate from
the blue line and make plays"

Sam Steel,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3YP3h3vvzI,"go pats go very mobile is a proud
supporter of your team bones you want
service you deserve it's as easy as one
two or three Perry mobile your sasktel
authorized dealer Tim I imagine it's
still a little bitter after that loss
but is there some serious optimism for
this team going forward as you look
ahead to your your 18 year old soon oh I
think you know like you said it's not
you know not the way we wanted to go out
but you know I thought it was a really
good series we played a pretty good game
seven I thought it could have went
either way and you know we just came out
on the wrong side of it but going
forward I think it's you know we have a
lot of young players and I think we're
gonna be you know just as strong or even
stronger next year youyou watched a
pretty special read last year with with
the injury but what was it like to be a
part of this one and another one for a
second straight year to go as far as
this oh yeah it was tough to watch it
last year but being able to you know I
guess I learned from watching it too but
this year being a part of it too is it
was special and you know just how
everybody comes together it's a pretty
cool experience if you had a pretty
strong second half kind of coincided
with Sanford coming just to what did he
bring to the team and what did you learn
from a guy you know who's been around
for a while yeah he's a he's a really
good player you know he said he's been
around for a while so there's definitely
things that you can learn from him you
know just the way he works off the ice
and carries himself so you know it was
great to get a guy like that at the
deadline for yourself now going into the
offseason and waiting for the draft
what's running to your mind is that
approaches uh you know not much I think
I've done everything I can now you just
you know kind of let the cards fall into
place and just focus on training and you
know trying to develop as a player so I
come back next year even stronger we're
some of those things that you're
folks I'm working on to Kruger game uh
you know I think just getting in the gym
getting stronger you know as you get
older at some strength should come so
just that and then you know get get on
the ice too and work on you know just
skills and work on my shot and
everything really"

i'm more pessimistic than jaina because
she has unquenchable optimism really
uh so uh she loves her life and all the
people
more than me
i think we we learned from uh
character zhenya uh for
our lives how to live how to be
joyful helpful hopeful
and
more optimistic
to the to the world to people around you
to our families uh
[Applause]
to every person who were
near you
and
to be more open to the world
the main happened uh
during the shooting of the first season
that uh constantine and jenia as the
characters of the series
they finally become a couple in real
life
and this is the main story which i guess
they will continue
the story
i guess i got it from my head
i don't
know i think that our main message is
our main character zhenya
it's the message that you have to fight
whatever happens in your life bad or
good things you have to move forward
believe that everything will be great
you have to trust in you trust in good
people who surrounds you
i think that you have to believe in
everything good that
hap that is in life and that life in
life can happen so i think all the
message we want to say our virginia says
it to the viewers
[Music]
okay
[Laughter]
no we were surprised of course we were
surprised and we were
happy because we are the first russian
serial uh
and in the one
russian serial um
series which uh
selected which was selected uh and
it was i i don't know it was for for us
it was uh important to share this story
uh with the world
to show
everyone
this
optimistic story
about jaina
i think that you have to watch this
series because you'll find out
that the world is not that bad as you
think and people who live
in this world they're good and still
there a lot of happiness and kindness
and
good people who can make good things i
think you have to watch it to believe it"
Tyler Benson,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_u-5YqYHwnA,"well uh just uh it seems like the
obvious question we always when we get a
player we ask them how they feel Camp is
going and and for you how would you
assess the way things have gone so yeah
I know I've been happy with how Camp's
gone I've felt good on the ice uh it's
been a good group to be with and to
compete with on the ice every game but
no I feel like I've made some big
strides again throughout the summer and
I feel like I've played well
any
so many players it's maybe hard to get
one-on-one time but obviously Jay's
familiar with you uh you get any kind of
feedback or is it more just trying to do
what you feel like you need to work on
in order to make the kind of impression
you want to make yeah I know it's a lot
of it's on you uh doing it yourself but
I've been able to have some one-on-one
time doing some video doing a little bit
of extra things just to make sure that
I'm doing what the coaches are asking of
me when you look at your off season and
how it went and then you get to camp and
you're trying to apply those things
whether it's Fitness or working on
different skills have you been able to
to do that so far yeah for sure I feel
like the things that I worked on in the
off season I've been able to apply and
they've been showing in the game so I've
been happy with how that's gone so far
and I guess I just want to keep keep
continuing to build on my game
throughout the camp"
Rasmus Asplund,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iRUXJiMuGY,"uh you know they have a pretty good or
the full roster over there and I think
it was a good wake-up call for us but
it's coming out on Thursday how about
defensively it seemed like y'all were
out of sync in the defensive Zone as a
five-man unit well how did you feel
defensively yeah yeah I think we were a
little bit off thinking in every
perspective of the game today a little
bit on their heels and when you play a
team like Pittsburgh it's going to be
hard to to get some offense or get Space
anywhere on the ring so I think we just
were on our heels the whole game today
overall you're four and two in the
preseason how do you take the whole
preseason as you look at it as a team
for yourself how do you take the whole
preseason I'm excited I think the whole
city of Buffalo should be excited for
what we have going on here in the in the
locker room as a group and as an
organization I think really got
something good going on here and I think
everybody should be really excited
because we got something good going on
what's the challenge Rasmus when you're
facing a power play like theirs and you
guys are using different Personnel you
know it's just different than it would
be in a regular season right yeah yeah I
mean we really need to Bear down you
know uh how the hockey is nowadays it's
PowerPlay and penalty all that usually
is the outcome of the game who's coming
coming out on top so we really need to
to Bear down on both sides of that even
uh Power Play and PK because it's gonna
be a big difference so maybe two games
Jack and JJ have been in the lineup a
ton in the preseason what have you
noticed from those two guys really
really good players I think they're
growing for every day they're going out
they're practicing games and you know
it's going to be exciting to see what
they gonna get for us here in the
regular season it's six days before the
regular season starts now is that too
long would you wish maybe it would start
you can't do anything Bob but do you
wish maybe you'd start a little sooner
yeah yeah both both yes and no you know
I think it's good for you to get that uh
you know a little excitement starting to
build there now and over the next week
and you know uh Wednesday night when you
go to bed you're gonna be a little you
know like a kid on Chris day before
Christmas so I think it's good to get
that build up before before the whole
middle prayer you've had some time at
center now you've spent a couple years
at Wing now you're back at Center which
is when you became a buffalo saber is
what you were how's it going for you I
think I I'm feeling pretty comfortable I
think I need to work a little bit more
on the defensive side of it because it's
a little different from playing Wing but
you know I've been playing a lot of
Center growing up and I started my pro
career at Center so it is somewhere back
there I just need to to find a little
bit more but I I think I'm making a
pretty good uh transition here
thank you guys"
Andrew Peeke,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ6p4z5DnX4,"the obvious question uh you're
getting the chance to get back in the
lineup tonight i mean how do you think
the time in cleveland helped you and
what are you excited to kind of show off
tonight when you get the chance uh yeah
obviously excited for tonight
um you know another opportunity another
challenge um
tonight and i'm excited uh to show what
i can do and what i've grown
uh since going to cleveland um for me um
i was just trying to play really
consistent every shift making a positive
impact on the game and
controlling the game in my eyes and how
i use that
to pertain to my game so for me i took a
lot of good steps and i'm ready to go
yeah you're still a guy that is young i
mean you did have pretty much a full
season last year between the ahl and nhl
level but this year with everything
that's going on
i mean just did it help to get games in
and just really get that chance to gain
more experience and play down in
cleveland
yeah no i mean obviously it's always uh
it's always kind of a tough thing when
you when you get sent down you always
always want to be here in the nhl but
for me i just took the mindset to
improve my game
and find my way back up up in columbus
and
um yeah no cleveland's a good spot i
worked a lot with coach mccarthy down
there
he's an awesome guy he really helped me
as far as the monsters i mean they're on
a tear right now and you were a part of
a lot of that
i mean just what in general was kind of
working down there because it seems like
that's a team that's playing with some
confidence and we're seeing a lot of
young guys like yourself having some
success down there is there something
that's just kind of working right now
with that team with
the experiences you had down there yeah
no as a group we had tons of confidence
playing fast we're playing clean um
biggest thing i noticed down there is we
worked so hard on the breakouts
and you could tell when we were exiting
the zone clean it was
it was so tough for other teams to
defend and um
for us obviously as defenseman we get to
join up the ice when we have clean
breakouts and it's just
so much to our advantage and yeah it's
just a ton of confidence down there
right now
and you guys are playing good so it was
a fun ride
awesome thanks andrew good to see you
again okay next we'll go to brian
hedgerow go ahead brian
yeah hey andrew uh welcome back um
you know when you look at uh this thing
from a big picture standpoint how
important
is it for you especially as a defenseman
to kind of just
you know look at it that way and say hey
there could be ups there could be downs
uh and you just kind of have to roll
with it a little bit i mean everyone
wants to be in the nhl
but it doesn't always happen right away
right now kind of like what you said um
there's always ups and downs throughout
the season
whether you're in the lineup or not
whether you're you know in columbus or
in cleveland but for me
i was trying to approach each day with
the same mindset and try and improve my
game
and uh trying to be the best version of
me on the ice and
coming in here at the later part of the
year that's what i'm going to try and do
and play consistent and play my game
usually
would you say that you were uh prepared
for it
you know when you know obviously like
you said it's disappointing to go down
but were you
do you feel like you're kind of prepared
for it no matter what happens
yeah i mean obviously you never get to
know
specifically when you're going to get
sent down or get sent up so
you know when that happens you just kind
of have to approach the day and
approach going to cleveland during
mindset because go
one of two ways and for me i just really
wanted to work on my game and
work to get better every day i found my
game bound
i'm in a good spot right now from the
game i'm happy and confident so
i'm excited how much did you know coach
eaves down there help with that you know
when you get down there and that
transition back to the
you know playing for the monsters oh no
he's great
uh great with the young guys with uh
trying to develop your game
and let you play with confidence and you
know right when i got down there
initially when i got sent down i met
with him and just talked things over on
things i wanted to improve on things
that i thought i was doing well things i
could
you know be consistent with and he
really helped me with that so
he's good thank you okay
and finally we'll go into mark shaw my
heart thanks glenn hey andrew welcome
back
um just want to get your thoughts on the
taxi squad this year
just something you normally don't get
every year but you know kind of a half
in half out situation
was it nice for you to be able to spend
some time there given that you would be
able to practice with the big club
yeah i mean i think the texas squad was
kind of new for everyone
i didn't necessarily know one way or the
other what it was going to be like
so obviously when you have your practice
days
and you're not playing you gotta find
ways to
you know be engaged and improve your
game on a daily basis because obviously
you're practicing a bunch so for me i
was just trying to find ways to improve
my game
and you know do little things extra
little things before after the ice that
would help me
and i just want to ask you real quick
about david savard i know you even had a
lot of time with him but just
how much do you mean to you and how much
were you able to learn from him in the
time that you did get to spend with
him i mean i mean first of all he's an
awesome guy as you guys probably know
um you know every every time i've been
up in columbus
he's always been good to me you know
always reaching out for help or anything
like that you would always take it and
help me out so just just watching him as
a player
you know what he does on the ice whether
that's block shots whether that's
taking hits make a play or battle for
the goalie he's just an awesome guy
you know obviously you wish him the best
but he's someone i definitely looked up
to for sure"

Pascal Laberge,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVzU82GYx6g,"mariners welcoming in a new face this
season pascal leberge former member of
the redding royals the maine mariner
fans may remember him from that also a
lot of time with the lehigh valley
phantoms former draft pick of the
philadelphia flyers pascal nice to see
you how are you
i'm pretty good are you
i'm doing well um we're excited to have
you here i'm sure mariners fans will be
excited uh when they look up your resume
and saw that you're a second round pick
um
the the first question i want to ask is
what what attracted you to maine uh why
did you decide to sign here
uh so when the season uh ended for us
this year riley reached out to me and uh
i think uh there's a really strong uh
strong fan base in maine and i played
there a couple times too and i really
like the atmosphere and the city is
awesome too and the fans are amazing so
that was an easy easy choice for me
yeah i was going to ask you played here
a couple times as a visiting player as a
member of the reading royals i think you
scored a goal
at least once um
what do you recall about coming here as
a visiting player
uh just the fans they were
really loud and they they loved their
team so i'm excited to be
playing for for the mariners this year
the 2021 season was weird for everybody
some people weren't even able to play at
all like the mariners for example but
you were able to play a little bit for
lehigh valley um i'm sure it was weird
not having any fans playing the same
teams a million times
um what was the 2021 year like for you
super weird like you said
i think we played three teams all year
so we played them like 12 times each and
uh no fans in the building was really a
weird atmosphere so looking forward to
have fans in the stands this year uh
yeah it's gonna be fun
you spent uh three years as a pro here
so far um the 2019-20 season you split
between the ahl and the echl what
differences do you notice between the
two leagues how big of a gap is there
really between the echl and the ahl
uh
i'd say the difference is uh like in the
east coast usually you play with three
lanes so
uh you have a lot of ice time and you
play power play pk you play like
everywhere
but uh in the american leagues four
lions uh sometimes your role is way
different you're like bottom six player
you'll you'll play maybe 10 minutes
and uh
in the uchl i feel like i played way
more minutes
that's the biggest difference
well for any fans that might not
remember you all that well from when
they saw you on the enemy side what can
you tell them about the type of player
you are what you bring to the team
say i'm a two-way player i like to
to play offensively try to
help the team score goals but uh i can
play a physical physical game as well
and uh
just be
dedicated to the team
awesome well uh good talking to you
pascal thanks for taking a little bit of
time uh looking forward to seeing you
here
in just under uh nine weeks now uh for
opening night
thank you"

Adam Mascherin,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=d-i3tAnUf8s,"um just when you look back at your
entire season
um what in what ways did did your game
improve the most and what were you
happiest with coming out of it
um i think my transitional game probably
improved the most
um my foot speed um and turning pucks
from the d zone to the ozone
was something that they preach they want
those you know three first hard steps
that's something i really worked on this
year
um yeah i really like
my my offensive game i think that kind
of came back to me i know i had a good
year in my first year my second year not
so much so it was good to get my touches
in this year and get those points back
up and
contribute again and show everybody that
i can
can score and i can play
sod you can keep going if you got more
i'm good
okay let's go to matt
hey adam uh just i know we thought
earlier in the season about
how uh how you kind of changed your game
a little bit coming into the year and
i'm curious does a year like this one
change your
expectations of making the nhl next
season
i mean i think you show up every year
with the expectation of trying to make a
team
um i think i put myself in a
conversation
i would like to thank um the year i had
i think
for me nothing changes i show up every
year ready to play hockey that's
you know my job but um yeah i would love
to
get the opportunity to show what i can
do up there and
play for sure and what does this summer
look like are you staying around
texas a little bit or you're gonna go
there
yeah i'm going home back to the summer
to train with with my trainer
been with him for five years and things
have been going well
uh it'd be good to see my family again
because i haven't seen
anybody for six months so i can't we
can't be staying here for any longer
yeah what kind of improvements are you
looking for this summer
uh i mean i think i want to continue to
get faster i think i took some good
strides in that last summer
i think i i saw the results uh so i want
to continue to push on that
probably my biggest thing is to keep
getting quicker and
stronger i think my my online skills
obviously work on those and
keep shooting and keeps the camera and
skating but probably in the gym just
working on
like explosive stuff
okay let's go to patrick yeah
adam um what do you attribute to your
bounce back here at last year
you had some trouble uh putting the puck
in the net and this year obviously
you know it seemed like everything you
you put on that went in
um probably a 13 month off season a lot
of time to reflect
a lot of time to to work on you know the
things that i thought i needed to work
on
and a lot of time to relax and just
de-stress from that was probably the
first year of my life where i wasn't
producing very well and it was
frustrating and
so probably just yeah the entire
offseason i would i would say
shaped me into to having success this
season
and what were those things that you
really keyed in on during that off
season
you know that that helped you come back
this year uh
for sure shedding shedding some weight
some body fat down
and uh working on my quickness my first
three steps
and something that i took into
continuing to work on this season in
game but
i was working on that a lot in the
practices and uh reworking on my shot
obviously since i had the the shoulder
surgery i spent a lot of time working on
making sure that my release and my power
was was still there
and rebuilding that shoulder it's my
bottom hand so that's the the power hand
right so i spend a lot of time
on shooting as well those three things
yeah
um you know when you go home this summer
you see your family your buddies
uh even maybe 10 years from now how are
you going to describe this season
and you know good bad and otherwise you
know for what
everyone went through yeah
i i'll describe this season as as i mean
like
it's not really probably unique unique
would be the word i would use
uh frustrating uh but also fun
in in certain ways uh it was annoying to
get kova tested every single day that
that part wasn't fun but
it was cool you had you were kind of
forced to spend time with your entire
team
so i got to know a lot of the guys
really well on a year where maybe you're
not spending as much time with guys
outside of the rink but
we couldn't do anything else so that
part was was a lot of fun and
uh yeah i won't say that i'm gonna miss
the structure of this season but
it was cool to kind of go through it and
uh
i hope i hope nothing like this ever
happens again in the world that's for
sure
thanks taylor
yes thanks um so obviously a lot of
emphasis is put on the physical side
and what you want to improve on there
but you know after
having 13 months where you couldn't even
get on the ice and
um you know so much time away from the
game what did you do to focus on the
mental side of
everything that happened this season
um i think just the reset uh
my girlfriend's got a lake house spent a
lot of time on the weekends there and
it's just a nice place to relax
uh i just got a dog so i'm starting to
kind of do things to take my mind off of
just hockey
uh i gotta start golfing though that's
one thing all the guys do that they say
helps relieve stress from hockey and i
haven't quite got there yet
so now i think for the future i need to
start learning how to golf and hopefully
that'll help
my mental side of the in-season
it's a nice little off-season hobby
there for you
thank you yeah adam we we talked earlier
with
riley just kind of on on the line and
and we've talked
kind of a lot about it this year but how
strange was it to
really be with that group for pretty
much the entire season from
start to finish and what did it do for
your game
yeah i i think when you like are you
referring to playing with like bafst and
dammer
yeah i think i think just like the
comparability and like
knowing where your line mate is going to
be and having that chemistry
just makes the game a little easier like
sometimes if you're second guessing
where a guy is going to be
you might turn the puck over versus you
know i know babs is going to be here
so i can chuck the puck there don't even
have to look i know he'll be there and
we kind of had that chemistry going
right from the start so
it made the game a little bit easier on
all of us
and just all in all you talked about
your rookie season to now
um what's been the biggest change and
adjustment for you going from that first
season
um to this season in which you i mean
you put 18 goals in half the time
basically
yeah i mean you just
start to learn you learn how to be
successful i mean
either you grab the bull by the horns or
the bull's gonna get you right so
i kind of have had to take a step back
and realize what didn't make me
successful my second year versus what
did make me successful
my first and third year and kind of go
from there and i think
if i'm working hard and that's that's
the biggest thing right if you're
putting the effort in
the hockey gods are going to reward you
for it and if you're not they won't
and i just think i think effort first
and be a good person
and the hockey part will take care of
itself
perfect any other thoughts from anybody
yeah real quick uh adam i
just wanted to ask you about riley uh
what was
the uh production that he had this year
surprising to you or
i mean could you have seen it coming as
someone who's you know worked with him
and things like that
i mean yeah he's a good player i think
any time
you have the skill that he has in the
talent that he has combined with
the season that baptiste and myself had
you know we're all gonna put up some
good numbers and i think he's got the
ability to play
at this level in the next level and do
the same thing he did this year for
years to come i think he's a really
solid player and i think he's a solid
dude"
Alex DeBrincat,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryYZ3q0N1Ag,"most of the time when a new player comes
to a town you go okay what's the
acclamation period been like but for you
this is home there's still an
acclamation period though what has the
adjustment period been like for you yeah
it's been a little bit different uh you
know doing training camp still having my
parents nearby I think it's uh a little
bit different but um it's been fun to be
home I think you know familiar with most
of the areas and and stuff like that so
um it's been pretty easy opening night
the wing wheel on your sweater it'll be
one thing to do it on the road to have
opening night at Little Caesar's Arena
what's the anticipation like for you
yeah I'm excited it should be uh you
know a dream come true you know putting
that Jersey on it's um you know
obviously growing up huge Red Wings fan
I think there's so much history behind
the jersey and and you know everything
in this organization it's uh it's just a
lot of fun and it it should be um you
know special Night 40 goal scorer it's
the title that comes with you it's
almost like Academy Award winning actor
uh when you hit that 40 goal Mark it's
something special you've done it how can
you get back there this season yeah I
think uh you know just focus on you
Burying my chances I think try to create
some good luck on your own you know work
hard and you know do all the little
things and I think you know the hockey
Gods reward you so um you know I think
you just got to play hard and and
hopefully be in the right areas how much
does knowing Dylan linwell and knowing a
bunch of guys in this team how much will
that help not just getting used to
playing here but how much will it help
your production early on you think yeah
helps for sure I think um you know
knowing a decent amount of guys before
you know I even get traded here is nice
and you feel comfortable right away and
there's no um really not as much
transition period so um you know it's
it's been good so far I feel right at
home and um it's been great I asked
Dylan a lot what's it going to be like
for you on opening night with the ticket
requests is there a point where you're
going to have to stop it and keep it
maybe to some family members or their
distant cousins reaching out hey you
know would love to come to the arena man
yeah unfortunately I just tell them all
to get their own tickets and um you know
I guess maybe opening night but every
other night you know just uh you know
focus on the game not really worry too
much about it and um you know maybe see
them after the game you've had success
here in other sweaters coming in and
playing against this team growing up
though going to the Joe what are your
Joe Lewis memories is there one that
sticks out um yeah I mean I feel like
just going to the playoff games um when
I was little was you know such a fun
atmosphere and so cool to see and
obviously you dream of being there one
day and it's uh definitely cool to to be
here wearing that Jersey and um yeah but
I I don't have one specific memory from
from when I was younger but um I think
you know just the crowds at the playoff
games were were unbelievable and it was
fun to be a part of that it's just been
a few weeks man but do you get a sense
that that that roster that group that
you have in that locker room can bring
some of that energy into this building
and and contend for a playoff spot maybe
this year yeah for sure I think we've
got a lot of great players um you know
our depth throughout the whole lineup is
is pretty good and um you know I I think
it's just important to have a good start
um I think everyone in there is excited
um about what we can do and um you know
kind of just focus on each game at a
time so um you know it's been good so
far but we got to really focus on
Thursday night"
Cameron Morrison,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIYitzRlbDY,"women fctv with Cam Morrison looking
ahead to having water noodle at home in
the National League South how are you
feeling about it cam how are you feeling
going into that one yeah as a group
where we're all looking really looking
forward to it
um another local derby
um
for us and again with it being
non-league weekend I'm sure there'll be
a bumper crowd down at Woodside Road
um like there was a down at Heaven
earlier on the season and no doubt
they'll bring a number of fans
um I see I'm really looking forward to
that Prospect I think the these types of
games really put it into perspective in
terms of
where the groups have been together for
a for a couple of years now and where we
sort of come from and in terms of the
the days of bright and see away on a
Tuesday night and and those types of
games like these are the games as a
group and staff and and players that
were that we've really got to relish
really
um all the preparation in terms of
leading up to the game will of course
stay the same
um in terms of what we're doing our
approach to the game and
how we go and play that won't change
um yeah obviously from I'm sure from a
far perspective there's a bit of a an
extra spice to it with it with it being
on League day and a bumper crowd and a
local derby
um but nothing will change change for us
in terms of our approach to the to the
game really you mentioned the last time
he played them it was early this season
back in December and as you say big
crowd there big day and what a big
result for us the 5-1 win what were some
of your memories from that previous game
um any hope of that being repeated again
on Saturday cool that again seems a long
long time ago the amount of games that
sort of happens in this league with
Saturday Tuesday if it feels like a
lifetime ago
um
but now look obviously on that day we
played well and and come out with the
result that obviously we wanted but
we're fully aware that having her an
excellent side
um I've got some some excellent players
and they're up there for a reason
um they'll be fighting for
for a player Sport and there's no doubt
that there'll be a they'll come here and
will be an excellent size so
um no Mandarin place as well so give you
lots of prove there and yeah we'll look
we're just looking forward to looking
forward to the game and
just really got to focus on ourselves
and make sure application and the game
plan is if it's implemented well and
yeah we'll go from there really and
hopefully ultimately get a good
performance and I think
with good performance and that'll be a
part by product of a good result come 5
30 on Saturday so it's been a little bit
difficult for both sides recently having
them winning nine we obviously had a
poor running results recently as well
what do you think got into this is both
teams having nothing to lose with this
or does that make it easier or does it
make it more difficult
um
I'm not sure I think that you can whip
out all the cliches out there but there
is generally like a look last couple of
results haven't gone away but we stick
to the same processes and sounds of like
a real young group and just continue to
try and analyze and learn and develop
from it and from the last sort of
performance and and that's what we'll
look at and
yeah we'll take the Learners from the
last couple of games and the last week
and get back on the train and pitch on
Tuesday Thursday and
yeah just go and try and Implement
improvements sort of as individuals and
as a group and yeah see where that Texas
come Saturday but yeah they will
generally be
don't look too far back it was just as a
group would just generally look to try
and keep on improving and and see what
that takes actually awesome and um
looking at the school heading into
Saturday is there anyone that you think
won't be available or anyone who might
be coming back in uh no it should be a
pretty um
no real difference from last week in
terms of the squad selection
um
so yeah we'll get through training
tonight and
um yes that's one at one or two but you
know
um nothing in terms of a change from
that really"
Nathan Bastian,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAfDtJFLR64,"playing at home we heard from Lindy Ruff
that he felt there was more desperation
here in the last few games is that one
of the factors that you saw with this
team playing better yeah well I think
you know obviously uh you know improving
this and getting these wins at home is
really a big thing and uh coming out you
know the second half of the Season all
these points are important even just me
getting those overtime one points and
then pushing for the second one I
thought we did a really good job at that
and then just down to the details you
know blocking shots and all those little
things that really makes a big
difference in the end of the game and
um you know really that's really helping
us get those wins I know Lindy also said
he felt things were maybe overcooked
please do you feel like the team is
trusting themselves more playing a
little bit more simple at home yeah well
I think obviously
when you're at home you know you're in
your your comfort zone your own rangong
fans there's a lot of positivity towards
all that and I think just when you put
it all together trust yourself your
instincts the your teammates everything
and uh you for example you go towards
last night you know the power play
running took advantage of it and black
he had a great game but like you know no
one really scored that many on five on
five and special teams were the
difference Dougie Hamilton's had a
career year right now he's had a new
career points level for himself what
have you seen out of his play
offensively I know he's a defenseman but
offensively what have you seen of him
yeah obviously he's having a he got a
real touch for the net there now like
bucks are going in from making great
plays uh I'll see the fun player will be
out there with and he's been a
Difference Maker you know he's really
taken over some games uh scoring some
big goals and it's really helping us get
those points at the end of the game we
hear good teams find ways to win and
this team has found many ways to win
here what level of confidence does that
give this group that you can get through
over time wins you can get those points
but now you can also get points and
regulation again yeah it's great you
obviously want to every game you want to
go out there and have your best and
sometimes that's not the thing and other
teams are going to bring their a game
and you just got to make sure you find
those way to wins and it's a big thing
you know at this time of the year the
for the end of the year push and we're
making sure that we're staying ahead of
it and uh you know we're controlling it
right now and making sure we get those
points in what way does the team as a
whole share the responsibility of the
absence of Jack right now yeah obviously
well he's he's a star player he's making
a difference out there every night
scoring goals dominant every time he
steps on that ice and when you lose a
guy like that obviously a players got to
step up thing switches up but you know
we all we're all here for a reason we
trust ourself and I believe we can make
plays make a difference ourselves and
just being out there and you see guys
take over like as Dougie you know power
two big Power Play Goals blocking the
net like stopping the puck everyone
wants to give herself the best chance to
win and that's what we did when you're
having meetings prior to that first game
without Jack is there anything that had
to be tweaked or anything that was a
little bit different knowing that his
absence creates this big hole where
other guys have to step in
um I think
in terms of just the the lineup switch
there I I went back to Center and a few
different things like that because he's
a big part of that middle ice and
um I think a few things like that but
like I said we have our game plan in
place that we play and uh our system and
everything that we put towards for the
first star of the year we might want to
make sure that we keep it the same now
and uh but for sure we'll be happy when
he gets back in the lineup to help us
at home the past five games wins at home
what were some of the specific ways you
saw the team play better to get those
victories
um before we
tried to emphasize our home play like a
lot like we were
um obviously struggling at home for a
while and we're trying to take a little
bit more Pride playing at home in front
of our fans so
um
last couple games like last night you
saw I think it was kind of a full team
effort and I know um Blackie played
unbelievable and
um I think we had four lines chip in and
um to play good teams on the stretch
like that it's gonna have to be like
that most nights I think what about the
desperation Factor at home
yeah like you'd like to think that it's
automatically there I think you've seen
our crowd loss you know x amount of home
use has been really good and um you know
it gives you that extra little boost and
but that comes more desperation and I
think you could kind of see guys laying
on the line last night you talked about
Blackwood Hamilton another player who
played really well last night what did
you think of his performance
he's been sneaky uh great is I think uh
obviously you see his numbers he he puts
up and
um you know if you look if you look even
a little bit closer I think the timing
of all his goals are so big I think he's
been tying up games ladies and scoring
goals in overtime so
um when you're big players make big
plays like that that's what you need now
that you have those home wins you go
onto the road this team has the best
road record how does that help bring the
momentum into a four-game stretch
it's good we're coughing on the road so
it's fun we look forward to going on the
road and this will be a good test for us
totality is when a player like Jack goes
out and then you come back with a big
win right because he's such an integral
part does it change the mentality I know
do you know what I'm trying to get at
like when he's not there to be able to
come out with a win
yeah I think
maybe Jack more than anyone you notice
it right away yeah obviously
um you know every day of the week we'd
rather him be in the lineup but it
happens every every team their their
guys go down unfortunately sometimes
it's your your best guy and I think the
best teams are the ones that
um you know through injury can kind of
keep their their identity and play the
same way intact so you're missing a ton
of offensive
um
magic kinda and um when he leaves I
guess you know other guys pick up slash
but a different way you have to pick up
the slack right because no one can
replicate that well that's what he does
yeah yeah of course but that's what
that's 22 more minutes that other guys
get to go out and fill the puck and be
confident so
um like I said like every day we'd
rather Jack be there but unfortunately
right now we don't have them so it's
gonna be an opportunity for other guys
to
to uh play more"
Jonathan Dahlen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giGL9s0KuUs,"you're off campus you're sort of getting
better getting more acclimated back with
the smaller ice here
for sure yeah i think this was my most
comfortable game out there so but i
think i played pretty well
all games but uh
i added some offense today and got some
good passes and was more involved so uh
yeah i think i'm more and more
comfortable one thing that bob said was
that uh he you know likes your offense
but you know he wants to see how you're
doing other areas of the ice is that the
message that you received from him and
the coaching staff yeah that's what i've
been trying to show all camp what i can
do
except the offense so i can play by his
system the defense work hard and just
show i'm able to do all that on this
level and
then i know that i can add the offense
as more as it goes but my main thing uh
this camp has been to show that i can do
everything else on the ice because
that's what i was
suspicious that they wanted to see for
me so that's what i've been trying to do
and i think i've done a pretty good job
doing it and he said also that uh he
actually thought that your game might be
better suited for tighter areas and that
sort of thing like it is here and you
agree with that assessment yeah like i
said first or second day of camp i think
the smaller ice is a lot more fun it's
more small place and get open quick and
when you play with as good players as
i've been playing with you'll get the
pass when you're open so
i
i agree with that i think it's a lot
more fun i feel very comfortable out
there debut
i don't know if i made the team yet but
if i if i do it obviously it's uh it's
going to be a dream come true so but
i don't know i've done my best now we'll
just see next week what
happens as far as getting used to
playing with that
makes it so much more easier uh i mean
he's a great captain and great player
great guy so it's
so easy to come in and play with
with him and just just watching and
learning every day in practice and
talking to him it's uh
it's made a lot easier for sure so i'm
really excited to to have had the
opportunity to play with him
as far as getting used to playing at
this level
well it's uh it's everything from the
zone to what we're doing on face-offs to
everything just small things all the
time that make a big difference so
just
just everything basically
drills in practice
where he wants me to be i
[Music]
i'm just asking him as much as i can to
to be as punch and learn as much as i
can to to be as good as i can"

Boris Katchouk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMBeOHSjCk0,"all right Boris season is over for the
crunch obviously a ruled sooner than
everyone was hoping or expected but a
very successful year all in all for the
crunch when you look back at this year
gonna be what are you what are you gonna
remember from this season I just thought
we had a great lineup from goalies
defenseman and forwards I think we all
stuck together as a team throughout the
whole year we were never too high a
number too low hum we just stuck through
it a lot of great moments for this team
this year and a lot to be proud of
obviously for this group what are you
gonna be most proud of from what was
this season
just the way we finished I thought we
finished well and we battled to the last
game I think we were fighting for first
place the last couple games so no it was
cool to to battle with each other and
you know it's gonna be you know
memorable because it's my first
professional career so yes he's in
season and you mentioned it is your
first bat Pro years so what was what was
it like obviously a big adjustment for
sure what was it like for you yeah it
was I think from junior of the year I
think guys are much smarter much
stronger so I think the pace was you
know much quicker so yet to think
quicker so I know I just try to have fun
with it and it was just a good first
year from the start of the year to the
end of the year how do you think you
progressed as a player and what areas do
you think you improved the most um he's
just overall game I tried to you know
complete as a two-way player this year
and I mean I probably solidified my role
that weight and in the stretch so that's
the one thing I could take away like we
said so much to be to be proud of from
this group is there something from you
personally though that you'll take away
from this season as you head into the
offseason no I think it was a group
effort it wasn't just one guy that
everyone was pulling the rope so it was
just fun to be a part of you see the
playoffs it was just end up being four
games for the crunch - totally different
animal like we've said and what do you
learn from the playoff experience and
what do you take away from it as you
head into the summer
it was just when we didn't think we were
gonna end that quick so um you know we
expected much better things from from us
going down the stretch but you know
that's hockey sometimes and that's the
way it goes and you can't just you know
put your head down on it I just got to
keep going forward so I think coming in
next year we're just gonna you know try
better get into December what areas what
do you plan in terms of your summer as
you look to to prepare for next year
yeah I think it's like it's everything a
part of my game is it's not just one
thing that I want to work on to make
just like you know put it in front of
the the other aspects of my game so I
just tried to work on everything is your
first year here in Syracuse and the city
in front of this fan base what was that
like it was huge I think the fans were
were there supporting us as a seventh
man every game and we can't thank them
enough"
Chad Krys,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DokPlSYbZgA,"well you get a chance to talk to the
Toronto May police this has got to be
exciting stuff how did it go with what
you can tell us what can you tell us
yeah yeah know I like to think it went
really well I mean uh you know great
opportunity to get to get interviewed uh
by them right before the draft here so
hopefully uh hopefully that's a positive
sign what a time for USA hockey and the
group of guys you grew up with in an
arbor you look around you what's been
the key to so much success for you guys
in the last while yeah no I think uh
like you said uh the ntdp now I think uh
you know with all the top players going
out there for a couple years and and um
I think when you get that many talented
players in one in one group and and can
develop them together it's a competitive
environment and and uh raises
everybody's play so I think that's a big
help Jerry Deigo said when leaving
Bingington to go to an arbor it was a
tough first year at age 16 to leave home
what was it like for you yeah definitely
tough moving away from home and my
family and uh you know my bed at home
but uh no I think uh yeah those first
couple months are tough but uh you know
the bond that you create with your
teammates there is pretty special so I
think that that definitely helps and you
can't take away a world championship two
Springs ago and Maple Leaf product
Jeremy brao there to set it up in
overtime tell me about winning that
Championship tell me what it was like to
play with Jeremy yeah no that was
awesome me me and uh Clayton Keller and
and Jay goder being the the young guys
on the team uh it was uh it was really
fun experience to play with all those
with all those players you know Jeremy
I've known him for a long time so quiet
guy isn't he yeah yeah definitely not no
uh no to see him set up set up the game
winner I'm not surprised so uh he's a
great player you mentioned youngest
players you were the youngest player of
the World Junior Championships this past
season for Team USA didn't seem a big
deal to you wasn't it yeah I know I
think uh great experience uh very
fortunate to make the team and um you
know something that I can uh take with
me for the next couple years here at the
tournament and you're going to Boston
University following in your dad's
footsteps how important is that to you
and to maybe extend to Legacy is former
captain of the team a quarter century
ago yeah I don't know if he'd like that
it was that long ago it's 25 Canadian by
the way yeah no uh no it's really
special my mother uh played lacrosse
there too so uh really really cool thing
to be able to follow in their footsteps
and and go to be you and an opportunity
hopefully as well to play for Team USA
at the world junior is coming up in
Canada what do you expect in games in
Toronto and hopefully get a chance to go
to Montreal to win a gold medal yeah
yeah no uh really excited for another
opportunity to uh play for that team and
and uh you know hopefully I can make it
again and experience uh World Juniors in
uh in Canada that'll be awesome ironic
to see Keith kachuk Matthew here and the
Legacy that goes back between your dad
and his dad back at be you yeah no uh uh
got getting to know Matt over the past
couple years it's been uh it's been
pretty cool and especially with the
history that that our dads have uh it's
pretty funny how that's come back around"
Givani Smith,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi3E6erLelQ,"excited what uh what's it what do you
think will be like going back there and
you know going into the different
dressing room and things like that I
think uh this could be like going to not
locker room
um it's gonna be nice like looking up
and seeing all the Reds that's for sure
looking across the ice seeing a lot of
those familiar faces I mean you grew up
a little bit in that organization be
nice to see some of those familiar faces
again yeah it's been really nice I know
everyone on the team very well it's
gonna be nice to see all the guys again
it's gonna be fun playing hard against
them and you know rubbing them out and
stuff playing them hard but
part of the game last game first one
here at home free it's supposed to like
playing uh your first game here I'm sure
everything's new new room all that stuff
new fans yeah uh believe it or not I had
one of my games here against Florida was
a really good game you know so I was
really I love playing in this Rank and
then coming back playing on the home
side just felt uh just felt natural and
you had a good game last game here as
well you and Eric still really seem to
have some instant chemistry there what
do you like about playing with him
obviously a guy with a ton of experience
yeah I mean that's just I'm just so
fortunate like he's just uh he's a
Legend So for me to come out here and
they'll work hard and play alongside of
them makes the game a lot easier
especially like Lombard just just great
guys to be playing with a lot of energy
from Ryan Lombard just so what's it like
playing next to him with all he does out
there you know what it's it's amazing
because you see him go hard and it makes
me want to go hard and then just vice
versa
what's it been like for you okay you're
coming to this team obviously you know
you were originally assigned to
Charlotte but then you've been most of
your time's been up here it seemed like
the Panthers really wanted you and
wanted to get you here
does it feel good that I didn't know
that the Panthers did that yeah it feels
amazing I guess Florida is a special
place and to live here and to play here
it's like it's like a dream come true"

Carter Hart,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-RbAuqItAk,"how are you feeling coming into year two
of playing John playing for John Toledo
what did you learn about him last year
that's kind of going to make that
process a little bit easier this year
no I think uh all of us planned for him
last year that are returning got to know
him better and
nobody's like as a coach did the daily
process and The Daily Grind of an NHL
season and I thought he was great I
think he's great for our group he pushes
us to be our best and he gets the most
out of everybody and he's a demanding
coach he's honest and I think as a
player that's all you can really ask for
from a coach
Carter the team went through you know a
good bit of change this this all season
a lot of rebuilding type of change what
was it like kind of
watching it from afar And the emotions
of watching guys go and guys come in
yeah I mean obviously uh sad to see some
friends go and guys that have played
here for a while with hazy and and Tony
last year
um
you know some good good guys good people
uh left and and I wish them all all the
best and on their other teams but
um I think the the people that we
brought in uh guys on our team players
uh We've made a lot of changes with our
staff and we're still making changes and
I think it's everything is going in the
right direction
um obviously we're we're in that rebuild
State and
um it starts with a good foundation I
think we're starting to to build those
pieces and lay the foundation out to put
this uh to get this thing going in the
right track Carter um we obviously asked
this to you in the start of last year's
Camp about the hockey Canada
Investigation it's been rumors that it's
getting closer obviously it's not out
yet I just didn't know if you had any
comment yeah I really don't know
um can't talk about it it's I wish I
could same thing but all I know is the
investigation is ongoing and that's all
I really know does it feel like there's
you know a clown hanging over you like
as you prepare for a season there's some
uncertainty with what might happen
no not really
um just coming into the rink every day
um taking things one day at a time and
and just preparing for the season
during the contract here does that add
anything to your mindset or is it just
like another season to you yeah I
honestly haven't even thought about that
yet
um it's been I think been under contract
the last couple years and it's just
another another season for me a season
to grow and and a season to get better
and and prepare for
um right now and
um no that's in the back of my mind I
just like I said I want to take things
one day at a time and just worry about
getting better one percent every day
kind of using that as jumping off point
at least in the beginning of the summer
there were some scattered trade rumors
with you in it obviously nothing came of
it but is that an added stressor when
your name pops up in media reports and
whatnot no I mean maybe a stressor for
my family and friends and they are kind
of in the dark and they don't know much
but
um no I mean uh Danny's a good good man
he's a good manager he's he's done a
good job coming in and
I trust him and I know that if something
were to happen he'd be he'd be the guy
to let me know and I'm I'm pretty
confident that I'm going to be a flyer
so I'm happy here I love playing for the
city for this organization and I love my
my teammates so I'm happy to be here
Carter piggyback off of Charlie's
question did you get to spend any time
with Carter parklow pretty sure he was
probably giving you some tips I didn't
see him this Summer no unfortunately I
went down to ever just to see my bill
that he wasn't uh in in the best of
health so I went down to see parks and
and he's doing a lot better now he
actually had he had open heart surgery
in uh in June and so he's recovering
well and and he's doing a lot better now
torches in here before he talked about
the potential for a lot of young
defensemen on this team obviously cam
New York most likely is going to be here
but between Grands and Jenning and
Andrea there's a chance that it could be
a very young group in front of you does
that change anything in your approach
when you know that there's maybe you
know four or five guys that don't have
the kind of NHL experience that the guys
before the Mad Pro Rob D'Angelo those
sort of things
no I mean I think the biggest thing is
if whether we have the six guys that are
kind of slated in now and they bring in
some younger guys to to get some
experience
um I think the biggest thing is
communication
um they can learn from from the other
veteran guys veteran defenseman and they
can learn for me and I can learn from
them so I think it's
whoever's playing in front of me uh we
just need communication and to trust
each other and and to build that trust
last season you're able to
because you're healthy
is here to finish with injuries and
winning team MVP so in the holes it was
you know I guess a good individual year
for you
um how do you assess that against kind
of where the team
for last year from last year again
I haven't really thought about that
um for me it's we're obviously made
strides we were a team that guys people
counted out quite a bit and I think we
surprised some people with how we
performed obviously not making the
playoffs is never
it's disappointing but I think we
surprised a lot of people and and made
some uh some uh we grew a lot last year
and I think going into this season we
have to continue to grow and I know
we're going to be a young group and
there's going to be growing pains but we
have to stick together and and try and
get better together every day is is
there a feeling in the locker room that
maybe people are unfairly discounting
you guys as a group in terms of playoffs
and things like that
uh not amongst us but I definitely hear
that from from you guys and from from
everybody else so I think there's uh we
have a good group in here we're young we
have some new faces that we're gonna
have to get to know and and build the
trust with each other and kind of build
that culture up back in our locker room
is the goalie version of the backscape
that the rest of the guys went through
oh it's nothing compared to those guys I
feel I feel so bad for them and like
guys are coming in and legs up on the
wall and just trying to get blood flow
going again so I feel bad for them but
we do we do it on the bike we do like a
VO2 bike yesterday so so we get bagged a
little bit too how was that
not too bad yeah I don't think it's as
bad as these guys out here but Carter uh
Carson burnerson I'm sorry if I
butchered his last name uh spoke very
highly with you last week and said that
you two went to a Phillies game together
and whatnot and he sort of sees you as
his uh you've sort of taking him under
his wing uh how does that make you feel
I hear that from a young Prospect
yeah I mean pretty cool he's he's a good
kid he's a good goaltender uh he's had
some success at the junior level and I
can see it here he's a great goalie and
he's going to be a great goalie to come
so
um I'm excited to get to work with him
here over the next week or so and and
show him the ropes a little bit about
what it's what it's like to be a Pro and
he's a great kid so I've I love helping
him"
Ryan Lindgren,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPltQWRDAFI,"um Ryan yeah it seems to be the opening
question for everyone but you're two
days into your summer and uh your
thoughts yeah it's disappointing to you
know for a dollar to be the summer
um
you know it was a fun year it was a good
year it's a lot of good things
um you know how to end up losing like
that and game seven was tough but uh
yeah like I said it was fun it was you
know we got a great group of guys here
great staff
um so yeah I enjoyed the year
um but definitely disappointing going to
the summer uh and speaking to the
specifics of the um your loss to the
devils and again it's early but when you
think about it is there a moment where
you think it was there and it
disappeared
yeah I mean you know start start like we
did to go up 2-0 in their building
um you know you're feeling good you know
and then to go home lose that game three
in overtime was a was a tough one and
then you know they ended up rattling off
three straight and able to win game six
and then you know lose lose like we did
in game seven was was really
disappointing you know to get shut out
and
um you know it was just it was tough I
mean credit to them they're an
unbelievable team
um you know they played really well you
know we fought hard did what we could
but to come up short was uh it was very
tough so again game seven it's not so
much the loss it's how he lost yeah I
mean uh you know get a shutout like I
said was was disappointing
um you know like I said they played
great you know they we couldn't get much
going offensively unfortunately
um you know they did a good job of
slowing us down and
um but yeah it was it was tough for sure
right are you gonna need any off-season
medical treatment no no
um yeah take some rest here and
um shoulder solo banged up but uh yeah
no surgery or anything like that which
is good
playing through it at the end was it
just a pain tolerance thing for the most
part or was there other concerns yeah I
mean uh you know when I first came back
it was you know pretty painful
um
but you know as it went along
um you know the the training staff's
great and um
yeah I mean it felt better and um you
know it hurt every now and then but not
too bad I felt like you got up to it at
least as close to where you wanted to be
by the time the playoffs came around as
you could have yeah I think so
um you know playing those five games
before a playoffs was you know I think
huge for me
um and I was out five weeks or whatever
it was so it was a little rusty but
um yeah I felt you know pretty good
going to the playoffs
um
obviously wanted to be better wanted to
help the team more than I did
um but yeah I mean physically I felt I
felt pretty good

Kale Clague,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFNKeBDtsZ8,"yeah definitely first game is the saber
like you said it's uh really exciting I
can't wait to throw on this jersey and
and play with a great group of guys in
here
Camp it appeared you had a good train in
Campa do you feel you showed well and
showed them that they need you you're
going to be able to fill in for them
yeah I feel like I had a good camp um
obviously I just want to keep building
throughout the year
um you know like you said I've played
before so
um the nerve shouldn't be there too too
much but
um yeah I'm excited to get going what
about your game fits the saber style you
think I think just the way I skate and
the way I move the puck obviously
there's a lot of skill up front down on
the back end so
um you know my job just to get the puck
get it moving up into their hands and
you know they'll take care of the rest
what excited you about this opportunity
when when the time came during the
summer
yeah I think just like you said the
style of play that they um that they
play here
um you know it's speed skill
um you know play Fast good transition so
I think that's what excited me the most
and um yeah I'm really happy with my
decision is this what you hoped for I
mean you know what maybe in the
beginning you might go to Rochester but
I mean here you are in the NHL it's
still October you're playing I mean is
this what you wanted I guess yeah I mean
you know anytime you get a chance to
play NHL um that's obviously really
exciting so
um yeah I came here with uh hopes and
expectations to get in and and uh
um you know I just want to play as best
as I can to help the team win you were
in Rochester just for a brief time
before you came up but how did that go
what did you think of the players down
there and just how did it go in the
brief time you were there it's good it's
a good team unbelievable coaching stuff
uh some young guys that are
um learning about Pro Hockey so
um you know there's you know a lot of
ups and downs
um
in that sense throughout the course of a
year in the HL but you know it's a great
it's been a great start and uh yeah it's
a great group of guys a new partner
obviously here is it difficult to get
used to a new partner no not too much I
think um you know we do a good job of
talking and communicating out there so
uh you know keep it simple to start but
you know as the game goes on we'll
um you know continue to get better
Amelia doesn't look like a guy who's too
hard to play with he looks like you know
you know what he's going to do yeah I
feel like it's pretty easy you know what
to expect from him he's he's very simple
and he plays hard he plays with an edge
so
um yeah I just I think good
communication good support will be fun
when you're out against players like
Kane change those types of players you
have to play them differently or is it
just you play your game I mean you
obviously have to know where they are on
the ice but um you know you don't want
to give those guys too much respect you
know they get too much time and space
they'll make you pay so I just want to
be aggressive and getting their face
just settling in Montreal for a while
and what was the experience like of that
season just you know moving to different
organizations and so forth yeah it was
good it was a good experience
um you know like I said it helped my
confidence you got more experience in
NHL to help me prepare for times like
this that I'm coming in and playing
um yeah it was a tough experience you
know
um you know not winning too many hockey
games but overall it was it was good I
enjoyed my time there and I think I
learned a lot
thank you"
Wade Allison,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp2dv7io9ws,"so tonight was a good game obviously you
know going forward do you think there's
anything that really needs to be you
know improved on or are you happy with
how things are going obviously there's
an improvement but just based off of
tonight yeah I think uh for us not to
kind of panic button there in the third
take a little more control have more
confidence in our game
um I think that could really help us
there we got real on for a little bit
but we stuck together as a group and
took our business how big was it to
answer right away until they they had
scored looked like they were going to
get some momentum out of it
and for you personally how big was that
role
that's new for me but uh I'm happy to
help the boys let's make the birthday
tomorrow it's pretty special yeah I mean
my family came down so this is my uh
first throw game I got to watch me see
on a few years here so uh see I'm happy
I see it if you worried for a second
you're gonna take a spill of your
celebration yeah
I mean I've been telling you guys the
whole time I mean he's a special player
now that he's healthy he's confident
he's doing the right things
look out I mean he's going to be a real
good player for us all five goals
tonight your goals were scored by
players 25 and under what does that say
for this team
doesn't matter who scores them as long
as somebody scores a movie score more
than them it's uh it's a collective team
effort you know it takes takes all 20 of
us over there and so it's just I don't
know maybe next game everybody over 20
miles
as long as you come up with two points
at the end of the game it doesn't matter
what was the move in the locker it was
John's first one of course the Flyers
head coach but what was it mean for you
guys to you know get that first one
already it's good we're having fun we're
having a good time in here
could you just talk just about the crowd
and the fans and how they reacted to you
guys and the energy built and I don't
know the last time I heard an organic
let's go Flyers chance so yeah I mean
that's that's what you love to hear as a
player I mean it gives you an extra
Advantage up there I mean fans here are
crazy it's it's unbelievable so uh so
that was awesome really cool tonight
thank you"
Filip Hronek,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjSbfyCGt0A,"[Music]
foreign
[Music]
so obviously happy about that and uh
only positive things I'm gonna change
things a little bit when we're Landing
went down on the first period obviously
the pairings kind of get jumbled a bit
yeah I kind of love to play with
everyone so
played a lot so I kind of got going
right away
does that help to
cook yeah for sure good to know everyone
during the games
it sucks to lose the guy right away
because you hadn't played in um
I don't think so I was nervous more
itchy than nervous
what do you think of the fans like your
first time playing for one pretty seven
goals on the board yeah it was a pretty
good crowd happy we could score for them
and they enjoy the game
is there a mindset that you have for a
first game like to sort of keep things
maybe more simple not to maybe take as
many chances as you might otherwise yeah
probably keep it simple I just started
for sure and then
try to just play the right way just in
general how do they feel to get back
it's been a while now just kind of get
back into did it feel like it didn't
take much warming up you're just right
back into the swing of things
yeah
we got 5D right away so
um I didn't have time to think about
anything I guess
[Music]
all right

Dillon Dube,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMbCRwlOFMA,"I always win tomorrow I think that's the
biggest thing um
you know it's uh
meaningful points and tomorrow's a big
game that's where we're looking at right
now is tomorrow and
um
when that
and then move on yeah go to the next one
is it tricky how you maintain belief on
the bench during third periods when
you're trailing Michael like how do you
keep the energy up on the bench in those
situations no there is I think uh you
know I think we know how desperate we
need to be in how how desperate we are I
think uh oh you got a late one there to
declaw back into the game and and have a
chance and I have a guy here stand for
it every guy wants to be in the playoffs
that's your goal at the start of the
year and it's come down to the wire here
and um
we have you guys feeling that and and
wants to put their best out every single
game to try and get in that's our goal
as a team from man to man to
you know look at each other and
try and bring your best every every
single day for these nine nine games
remaining did the task doesn't feel
bigger after last night obviously it
didn't result post here and out of town
here as well yeah you know I don't think
we're going to win 10 in a row so
um you know there's one here and there
we know we have to be really good down
the stretch here in these games
um it's been mentioned a couple times
throughout this year with the coming of
new players and integrating new
personalities that that has been some
sort of Challenge and remember really
that you were mentioning chemistry from
your vantage point being in the locker
room where would you say that issue of
integrating all these new personalities
and getting everyone to mesh ranks in
terms of I guess the list of things that
have unfortunately gone wrong for you
guys this year no I don't think so to be
honest I think this is uh got a lot of a
lot of leaders on this team guys who've
been in the league for a long time a lot
of Stanley Cups in this room
um you know it could have been a factor
the start of the year with chemistry
guys not playing with each other for you
know somebody has never played together
guys played together quite a bit
um I think it's more so start of the
year now I think this team's really
close together and
um you know it's uh we have a really
good locker room in here I apologize for
changing the subject and dropping ahead
of coffee and just try at night here in
a couple in a couple days there's been a
huge topic of conversation around the
league have you guys talked about it do
you have any sort of plans in terms of
you know how to show the lgbtq plus
community that they're sort of welcoming
hockey yeah I know we're here to we're
here to support it for sure and I think
um you know our organization is staff
members to fans to players in the league
um you know kids through minor hockey
are here to support everyone and
um you know there hasn't been too much
talk I think everyone's on the same page
here and um you know for me personally
I'm
um you know support it and you know want
to
all of our fans and everyone here to
you know to feel comfortable and feel
welcomed here and you know we us players
want to be a part of that any thoughts
on how it's unfortunately turned into a
story with how certain players and
decided to opt out any general thoughts
on on that no no that's their uh
you know that's more of a question for
those players for me I'm here to support
it
Dylan you're always really good at
providing perspective on this sort of
stuff can you put in perspective 900
games in one Jersey for Michael backland
tomorrow
um yeah yeah he's a guy
come into their Inky look up too I think
it's crazy that he's been here the whole
time and
you know one of the best professional
humans I've been around to take care of
himself and not even that I think away
from the rink
in this community
um you know you say that a lot about
guys but you kind of not emphasize
enough on how important he is to this
city and to this team he's
um yeah he's a guy cares so deep about
his team in this city that you come in
every day and you look up to him and you
want to follow him and
um you know I know for a lot of younger
guys like managing and Razzie and I
think you know he's helped us out a lot
and if we can be here for a long time
you want to
basically be exactly what he's been for
this organization he doesn't hold a
grudge that you took his fit his flame
title oh yeah I think
you know I
have some pride on that one"

welcome to Blackhawks Insider the
official podcast of the Chicago
Blackhawks presented by Chevy
driveschicago.com Drive what Kanan Taves
drive on this week's episode we break
down some of the highs and lows of the
Super Bowl both on the field and off and
we're joined by special guest Taylor
radish in his first full season with the
Blackhawks Taylor's having a career year
and he's got a birthday coming up stick
around you won't want to miss the rest
of this episode it's the Blackhawks
Insider podcast
welcome to the show I'm Chris Fosters
joined by Kaylee Chelios and Colby Cohen
big episode guys the the the seminal
sporting event of the year
certainly in North America
certainly in the United States okay it
was the Super Bowl I don't know you can
have the debate what's the most popular
sporting event in the world is it the
World Cup is it the Super Bowl
Canada maybe the Stanley Cup is more
popular than the Super Bowl either way
it was a great game there was a big call
by the officials at the very end and I
gotta say I was having flashbacks
watching the Super Bowl to the
Blackhawks Insider podcast I mean that's
how ingrained the podcast has become in
my mind you guys I was thinking
specifically about the episode where we
talked about incelli's or chirps whether
officials should have to address the
media for calls that they make during
games especially calls that have a big
impact on the outcome of the game and oh
by gosh by golly we had one of those
calls late in the Super Bowl last night
Kansas City driving with the football in
a tie game and a defensive holding call
against Philadelphia
allowed Kansas City's drive to continue
they ultimately kick a game-winning
field goal and were essentially able to
do so without leaving Philadelphia any
time remaining on the clock so we've got
one Philadelphia Eagles fan on this
podcast who actually brought up this
discussion Point earlier on the podcast
and I gotta ask you Colby what did you
think when you saw that play and that
call go down
well look I'm obviously a disappointed
Eagles fan today
um especially seeing the way that that
game ends they don't even get the ball
back into their hands you know look it
was a controversial call and I was
disappointed when that flag came out I
didn't you know I didn't think there was
a lot there but then after the game you
know Bradbury said he held them you know
the player said I put my hand on him I
was hoping I would get away with it
there's a lot of discussion about
whether they were calling the game one
way and then they didn't call the other
and and that's something you talk about
in sports is is referees setting a
standard but you know ultimately
I don't necessarily look at one play to
decide a sporting event you know the
Eagles were were up 10 points at
halftime and got their butts kicked in
the second half so disappointing
um would have loved to have seen the
official in a media scrum after the game
uh you know like I said on the podcast a
couple of weeks ago explaining his call
that he made but uh ultimately you know
not not enough there for the Eagles
Kaylee I I don't want to sound like a
bitter Eagles fan so I'm taking I'm
taking a tempered approach Philly Philly
sports fans have a bad rep and I I just
I'm I don't want to contribute to the
bad rap oh that's very generous of you
Colby and I I'm kind of with you like I
think it's hard
to judge a game based on one play and I
feel like in football many times too
after Super Bowls or big games I feel
like much more than in hockey those
calls are what stands out you know after
the game and fans remember those calls
years later I can't think of too many
hockey calls that are ingrained in my
mind as something that really made or
you know or broke a game for a team so a
little bit different but I'm with you
and that if there's a call that big
maybe I think the official does have to
explain things there's even times now
when I wish the officials would explain
things better in
um in games with the Hawks this season
even just looking at Sam Lafferty's
double minor penalty that he took in the
the game against the Jets I was very
curious how he was supposed to maintain
any more control over a stick than what
he had to negate getting that double
minor and I think Luke Richardson
watching him talk to the official after
two was trying to get a further
explanation so I think there's
definitely instances where that that
warrants a response and that's like the
gray areas where you need an explanation
to be able to kind of decipher what what
the next cause how the next call is
going to go if you're a player so and in
that sequence actually in that game you
know it did break the game for the Hawks
it kind of opened things up for the Jets
and they ended up losing four to one so
I I think there's definitely a room
there's room Chris for the officials to
have to speak when it's necessary
well and and Kaylee Chris I don't I know
she just addressed you but I I just
we're sitting in the studio and that Sam
Lafferty thing happens and like we have
no idea because the rule says if it's a
follow-through it's not a penalty so
then we basically start making our own
rules up in the studio and we're like
well maybe because he lost the puck and
he he he he he thought he still had the
puck but it was clearly a shot follow
through and then where's the gray area
the puck rolled off his stick but how
long before
a referee coming out after the game
Talking to the media scrum explaining
the call explaining what they went
through and explaining the rule
that puts all that to bed I mean in my
opinion so I would have loved to have
seen that too because it just it left us
really confused in the studio and
basically starting to make up our own
rules of like well maybe it was this
maybe it was that like we just had no
idea yeah yeah in addition to all the
pizza that I ate while watching the
Super Bowl I was also forced to eat a
slice of Humble Pie because that play in
the Super Bowl caused me to really
reflect on the stance that I had
on the on the podcast and I actually
found myself becoming much more aligned
with with the point that you made Colby
when we originally broached this uh
several weeks ago I gotta write that
down Chris aligning oh
it's a good debate that was a great
debate between the two of you we'll have
to we'll have to pull that one back up I
I'm comfortable enough putting it on air
I think the reason why I was so shook by
it was because I really did see two
drastic outcomes to this game because of
that call if that call is not made the
Kansas City field goal unit comes out
kicks a field goal and I'll give Kansas
City the three points there but they're
up with a minute and a half left in the
game at that point and Philadelphia has
got time to put together a drive to
either tie or take the lead in that game
and and the way that that that it ended
up playing out because of that call was
that the the eagles only had one play
instead of one drive to tie or take the
lead so I I thought given just how
drastic the the two outcomes were
because of that one call
that's why I I personally would have
loved to have heard why that call was
made and in addition I don't think it
should have been made and and I think
that's the key too in in a Super Bowl
versus
the Stanley Cup finals the NBA finals or
the World Series those are all the the
latter three are all best of three
Series so you can have a big call in one
of those games but still have sorry best
of seven series but still have the rest
of the of the series to play out and
sort of correct things but in the Super
Bowl it's it's one game and I just I
just didn't think the call should have
been made there but otherwise it was a
it was a heck of a game well I heard one
thing on ESPN today that I thought was
so interesting like I've never would
have thought about this as just a
football fan and I think it was Ryan
Clark uh who who played you know
defensive back or he was a corner he
played in you know one of those roles
and he said the mistake that was made
was the The Defender covering him should
have changed his glove color to start
the game to match the Jersey color of
the other team because on those plays
their hand doesn't seem as apparent
grabbing or holding onto the Jersey if
it's the same color and he said he
should have known better and that's
something that you talk about in the
backfield as a defensive player in the
NFL wearing the matching glove color to
the other team's Jersey to help not make
it as obvious and I know that's like a
little bit off topic here but I heard
that today and was like whoa that's a
that's a really interesting point yeah I
mean but it's but it makes sense because
those things are happening so quick and
there's so much hand contact in football
I don't know how those refs do their job
and to begin with right so uh tough loss
for the Eagles though we were we were a
little we were we were definitely
bumming out over here I know like our
dads who are lifelong Die Hard Eagles
fans my dad my life sad I mean they are
probably in mourning today I mean actual
morning so
you know gotta luck next year yeah I I
would be too at least the future's yeah
still white Jalen hurts played really
well uh for for all the hockey
historians out there I I will just say
that I had a conversation with with Troy
Murray about this today and he pointed
out the 1993 Stanley Cup finals between
the Wayne Gretzky LED Los Angeles Kings
and the Montreal Canadiens Blackhawks of
course were in Montreal this week to
play the Habs and in game two of of the
Stanley Cup finals there was a big call
against King's defenseman Marty McSorley
he was penalized late in the third
period with the Kings ahead
for using an illegal stick Montreal tied
the game on that power play they won
game two in overtime and then won the
subsequent three games in that series to
win the Stanley Cup and that was the
last time a Canadian team won a Stanley
Cup Final so there have certainly been
some big calls made in high leverage
moments in the Stanley Cup playoffs even
the Stanley Cup Final as well but we are
prisoners of the moment and actually we
talked with our guest Taylor radish
about his thoughts on the Super Bowl
some of the prop bets that were going on
and we got to know Taylor a little bit
more off the ice as well we really
enjoyed our conversation with Taylor we
think you will also take a watch or a
listen depending on your preferred
podcast platform medium of choice
and today we're chatting with Taylor
radish forward for the Blackhawks Taylor
thanks so much for joining us from the
Blackhawks road trip uh you know big
sporting event obviously to start the
week the Super Bowl did you have a
rooting interest in the game and what
did you think of it I didn't really have
a big rooting interest until some of the
guys we had some internal bets and stuff
like that and kind of makes a cheer for
a team so we ended up a lot of us took
the Chiefs and it was nice to see them
win but I'm actually a Bills fan in a
and a Packers fan so both of them got
eliminated so it's kind of hard to see
and um yeah but it was a fun day overall
just to kind of everyone be together and
watch the game and it was a fun night
so Kaylee and I and let's let's just get
to to get to the point here Taylor
Kaylee and I actually have rooting
interest for the Packers as well and you
know it's not really a popular opinion
given the fact that that we're all
working in Chicago now but uh I grew up
in Wisconsin so those are those are my
ties to the Packers Kaylee has family
from Wisconsin her husband played for
the Packers but uh what about you
growing up in in the Toronto metro area
how did you land on the Packers as your
NFL team I'm actually the complete
opposite I have zero relation to
Wisconsin area but my dad actually was a
big Packers Fan so kind of growing up
watching football there wasn't a
Canadian team other than the CFL but
feel like NFL is kind of the big stage
and you want to watch that so it's kind
of just followed what he did watch watch
the Packers on Sunday and I guess the
closest team would be Buffalo and ever
since the last couple years kind of fell
in love with that team and and uh
especially their quarterback there
so with the Super Bowl is there anything
else you won as far as bets goes did you
like Rihanna what did you think of uh
the whole halftime show yeah I thought
it was good what was the group effort
what did they all think I thought it was
pretty good we we uh yeah kind of I
guess we had some little bets on like
the props and stuff with uh internally
with the coin toss and stuff which
didn't work on my favor but um yeah I
thought it was all good the Rihanna
thing was it's always fun to watch that
we here in Canada we're in Montreal
right now and kind of the
we had the Canadian commercials so I was
a little a little different some guys
were upset about that but I feel like
overall it was it was fun to watch and
uh a good a good show for the night
I was I was thrilled with the with the
Rihanna halftime show and as far as prop
bets go there I did not think that Jay-Z
was going to come up on stage in the
middle and I was I was a little bit
nervous when she started singing some of
her Jay-Z collabs But ultimately uh I I
I cleared that hurdle also Taylor I I
wanted to ask you about actually a play
in the Super Bowl and specifically that
played late in the game where the uh the
officials threw a flag on that drive by
Kansas City that ultimately allowed
Kansas City essentially to to bleed out
the rest of the clock and then kick a
game-winning field goal you know as an
as an athlete do you not want to see
officials
you know make big calls like that in in
high leverage situations or or what did
you think of that play and that call
from an athlete's point of view
it's obviously it's hard with uh the
game so fast and kind of split the split
decisions just to make a quick a quick
call like that but
I feel like there's times in any game
they let stuff go things get called that
you don't think should be but at the end
of the day I feel like that's just the
way sports are and things are going to
go that way and it's always it's hard
when you're on the wrong side of it but
when you're on the the side you want you
want that call and you get it it's
obviously you want to take it and and uh
you happy happy with the result in the
end but I feel like it just goes either
way it's it's hard when when it is on
your side but that's just the way sports
are and and uh we need rest for for
those for those reasons
that was a great answer Keely I don't
know what you thought about that wow
yeah I agree that was a great answer we
actually got into a really big
discussion about whether or not it's
right for players to be able to make
comments on the officiating after a game
whether they should be fined or not from
the player's perspective how often do
you notice maybe officials kind of
doing things that would instigate you in
in some ways or like bother you on the
ice to where you feel like it you kind
of
you feel like you should be able to say
something about their officiating if
they're able to talk to you and do
things on the ice that you wouldn't
normally agree with does that happen
often or not really yeah I feel like it
does a lot it's the game's so
competitive and even the refs too the
game's at a high pace and they're trying
to be involved and feel the emotion of
the game as well so they when they make
a wrong call or write call and players
are pissed I know at times I've probably
yelled at a ref and stuff like that and
been frustrated but
I feel like as a player you got to kind
of flush it out as easily as you can and
it sometimes is hard like you're saying
so it's just the emotion of the game
that's they they have it too they're
they're right in there as well and
they're they're as close as anyone to
the game so it's it's it's hard out
sometimes but sometimes uh both sides of
It kind of give it to each other and I
feel like that's a fair way to do it
Taylor let's get to another big event
that's that's coming up later this week
your birthday
happy early birthday thank you turn in
the big 25 right quarter of a century
down that's uh that's a big milestone
man I know it's kind of crazy when I
you've kind of first started leaving
home at 16 and then to think now it's
like holy crap it's and it's turning 25
this year it's you don't really think
about it until you hit these numbers I'm
not old by any means but just kind of
every year just kidding
further and further down the line it's
kind of kind of crazy to think about
time doesn't stop and uh and and trust
me as someone who's you know I'm the
Elder Statesman on this panel right now
I'm in my 30s believe it or not so I am
actually old uh the the time only time
only accelerates but but in a good way
what do you think Kaylee
I mean I think so right I'm older so I'd
like to think that we're getting better
with Aid Chris so 25 still seems really
young to me it's weird looking at
birthdays now and thinking like I look
at guys that are in 93 92 and I'm like
you know they're older
uh it's tough but Taylor You've Had uh a
great ride so far you've got to play for
two really cool teams you're a part of
Tampa Bay's Stanley Cup success
um what have you thought about kind of
your journey now as you look back you're
gonna be 25 years old and you know
making your from making your NHL debut
with Tampa Bay to being traded to
Chicago like how how do you feel about
your game and just kind of the journey
to get here
yeah it's obviously it was kind of a
little difficult ride for me with just
first starting off in Tampa they had so
many good teams and you feel like every
year it's kind of your year to kind of
get a shot but I feel like my time in
down in Syracuse with Tampa Bay's farm
team was a big help for me just kind of
playing lots of hockey down there and
developing and kind of taking them
taking my time on me to kind of make me
ready to be able to play and I feel like
that was that was huge from for my
future and and for my career and it was
obviously like I said it was hard when
you feel like it's your time and it's
not and then uh yeah last year kind of
getting my first game there last year
was unbelievable with finally making
that team and kind of just putting all
into perspective and yeah I feel like
last year was kind of a weird situation
getting traded I've never thought I was
going to get traded it's always hard
like that but I was uh more than happy
to come to Chicago and so far it's been
uh great for me and I and I've I've
loved it every every second so far so
it's been a lot of fun
Taylor you mentioned that
I think you were gonna get traded I mean
how shocked were you when when you got
the call or were called in to the to the
general manager's office or whatever the
case was what what do you remember
feeling in that moment I remember we had
a day off actually and I knew Tampa has
the one of the hardest cap situations
every year feels like but it's kind of
in the same thing last year was they're
in the same spot and it was uh that was
a day off and they just randomly got a
phone calls kind of out of shock and
kind of felt like it was going to be
very hard for them to make a move and
they they ended up making one that they
wanted and
um it was just kind of a weird feeling
you you get traded and two hours later
on a plane and I was on a plane to
Minnesota we we had a 12 o'clock game
the next afternoon so it was kind of a a
crazy I guess less than 24 hours for me
When you mention like how hard it is in
Tampa like how great a team they had
trying to find where you could fit in
the lineup what sort of what did you
lean on or you know what sort of things
did you
kind of
like keep in mind when you're trying to
get to that next level and you realize
how competitive the team is I mean what
stood out to you about being able to be
a regular in the lineup with Tampa that
first year and what you were able to do
to get that opportunity on such a
talented team yeah it was almost just
kind of trying to find my role it was uh
the team kind of was set everywhere with
offensive guys and second line third
line fourth line so it's kind of
whatever spot I was kind of put in and
it was mostly third fourth line there so
it was kind of being more of a role
player and just trying to contribute
that way I'm not gonna wasn't gonna play
a lot of minutes every night and kind of
just had to adapt to working hard and
and being uh and trying to create as
much as I can with the time I had and
and just create energy for the team and
that was kind of my role there and
um I feel like it it helped me help me
for sure just kind of being put in a
spot like that when I haven't been
before and just kind of challenging me
on that
you know talking to guys Taylor and and
feel free to either agree or disagree
with this but you know it's it's one
huge step to just make the NHL but then
it it's another huge step to establish
yourself in the NHL and and really
become an NHL regular and it's your
second full season in the league now
you've passed the 100 game Milestone all
the while you know you were traded
you're you're with your second
organization so
with one almost full season in Chicago
under your belt uh you know starting
this season with with the organization
do you feel settled uh you know do you
feel established how do you think your
game has evolved here in in your second
season in the league yeah I feel like
just kind of never want to say you're
settled you don't ever want to kind of
be complacent with with what you're
given so it's I feel like just coming in
this year I I knew I was going to have a
better opportunity to play and get more
minutes and than I have in the past and
yeah I feel like just kind of at the
start of the year I wanted to make an
impact as fast as I could just to keep
solidifying my spot and in the lineup
whether it was whatever line it was and
I feel like just with the guys we have
on this team I know I feel like we've
we've kind of gelled really well and and
uh yeah I'm I'm happy with my game at
some points and sometimes I I feel like
I could be better and that's just the
way it's going to go throughout a season
and I just got to keep building and
building and uh yeah I never want to be
complacent with where I am and you
always just want to keep trying to get
better and I feel like we've we've we've
kind of done that in the recent couple
months here with with our team and we
just got to keep um keep building uh to
finish the season
it must have helped a lot having Boris
with you throughout the whole process
you guys go back to when you were young
kids played lacrosse together played
hockey together got traded together uh
how much did it help having him and what
sort of things did you guys talk about
when you were traded together last year
to the Blackhawks yeah it was actually
it's actually fun we've known each other
since I think we were nine years old We
we played on a team Ontario lacrosse
team so it's kind of been a while and
we've always been uh pretty good friends
since then and yeah just to have them
through every step just kind of makes it
a little easier whether it was finally
making getting drafted to Tampa and then
finally making the team we've kind of
just had each other for for by each
other's side the whole time and it's
it's a little less nerve-wracking every
day and then once we we got traded
together too was we didn't really know
the full details on on what was
happening I knew how I was going I
didn't know if anyone else was and then
once I found out he was too it just kind
of just makes the whole process just I
don't I don't know it's kind of a weird
feeling it's when you go by yourself or
I'm kind of a shy guy when I first meet
people and just to know I had Boulder
with me it kind of made it a lot better
for me at the start and I was actually
fortunate to know a couple players too
before so it was It was kind of an easy
smooth transition but I feel like just
having Bo there every step of the way
has been a lot of fun for both of us
Taylor
Caledon is where your hometown is listed
at understand that you were originally
from Georgetown and there are to your
point a couple other players on the
Blackhawks roster with Georgetown ties
Mackenzie Aunt whistle Jason Dickinson
now that you're getting settled in
Chicago though uh I'd love to hear what
you think of Chicago in comparison to
Toronto my fiance is from Toronto she
frequently compares the two cities a lot
she sees a lot of similarities between
Chicago and and Toronto the the
restaurant scene the the
multiculturalism kind of the vibe what
do you think what what's the what's the
compare and contrast between Chicago and
Toronto would you say yeah I would say
they're pretty similar just with the big
city and kind of all that but I feel
like I haven't been downtown as much as
now I live downtown in Chicago so I feel
like Chicago's got way better food and
um I'm kind of a big fan of that with
with all the restaurants we have and
we're fortunate to have in Chicago so
I feel like Chicago has that and uh I
also like it more because I don't feel
like it's as busy as Toronto I feel like
when you go downtown Toronto you're
you're stuck in traffic all day but in
Chicago it's sometimes heavy but it's
Max 10 and 15 minutes and per trial it
could be who knows hours and I feel like
uh that's a really good thing to have
about Toronto I mean uh Chicago as well
okay but please don't tell me that your
favorite restaurant in Chicago is
Gibson's Italia I know I actually seen a
lot of guys put that in
I'm uh kind of I really like that place
it's it's actually
it's kind of got great food and really
good vibe and it's kind of nice just
being over the river there
I don't yeah I don't mean to throw shade
at Gibson's Italia but it does seem to
be somewhat of a of a go-to response
that's a that's another
discussion Point Taylor I I would say
that we've uh that we've had on on the
podcast before all about the food
all about the food uh Taylor I want to
ask you about your lacrosse career you
uh multi-sport athlete growing up I
couldn't find any highlights when I was
Googling it on YouTube or anything but
it's I I did see that Dylan strohm said
you were a better lacrosse player than a
hockey player arguably so what was uh
your lacrosse background growing up and
um how did you decide between hockey and
Lacrosse yeah I feel when I was younger
I was kind of more into lacrosse and
maybe because I was a little better at
it I don't know when you're at a younger
age you kind of maybe that's something I
was doing but yeah I was I was uh played
in Halton Hills actually where
Georgetown is but it was just uh kind of
the bigger region so it was played for
Halton my whole life and um I think I
quit when I was probably 13 or 14 I'm
not really sure but it was kind of that
age group where you had to pick one and
maybe focus on one and I don't know what
it was but I uh I just kind of said like
I'm done with lacrosse it was kind of
kind of balancing out to where I was
kind of even at both and I feel like I
was getting tired of running I know it's
kind of cheesy to say but but running on
that hard floor all the time it was hard
on my knees and I was a heavier kid when
I was little I know some guys would give
it to me for that but it kind of it was
uh that was one of the reasons as well
but yeah I feel like um
I uh I really enjoyed lacrosse it was a
good sport to have in in the summer time
and I feel like it a lot of things
transition to hockey with and uh it's a
good team sport as well
have you always been taller than
everybody like kind of bigger than
everybody yeah bigger and taller I feel
like until until now I was when I was
younger I was a little heavier and I
know a lot of guys even with with uh
Mackenzie and Vicki and uh Boris
actually they all uh give it to me all
the time for that but it's uh just
something I uh needed to change and I
luckily I did
[Laughter]
puberty is a powerful thing man I mean
although hey I mean are you gonna have a
cheat meal for your birthday yeah I'll
order a pizza from somewhere I know
there we go kind of thinking that right
now but we'll we'll see maybe get the
guys over we'll do that
what have you found a good pizza spot in
Chicago that you like I feel like when
I'm on doordash it's everything every
time I look on it it's something with
pasta or pizza so it's kind of hard to
to swipe by it but I feel like right now
Jet's Pizza is kind of when I do it
that's what I go for and it's a little
heavier I get that four cornered Pizza
it's pretty heavy but whenever I do it
that's kind of the spot I choose to go
to
I I'm uh I don't know if it's like a
guilty pleasure but I'm a huge fan of of
Jet's Pizza you know in terms of like
the the to-go you know order in I know
it's not a Chicago chain or anything
like that I think it's Detroit actually
which is you know probably not good to
say but man it's uh the four corner it's
good and it sticks to your ribs too with
a little bit across there so
uh are you a Rancher then we had this
discussion oh no you don't dip your
pizza and Ransom please
I I never did until a couple a couple
years ago and then I started I started
doing it a bit and I'm I'm a fan of it
but I go either way I'm not really if I
don't have it I don't need it but if
it's there I I might throw on the plate
who converted you I just I don't know
who it was I think just kind of being in
the America I feel like that's because
in Canada I don't think Ranch is like a
big thing with pizza and kind of just
coming over here there's always a it's
on the side like on when they put the
sides out it was Ranch so
kind of uh just felt natural dip it and
it tastes pretty good
um Taylor you talked about being a
little bit shy when you first get into a
room but you had Tyler Johnson here in
Chicago and then you've got you know
some Big Time Players like Patrick Kane
and Jonathan tase but on Tampa obviously
a lot of future Hall of Famers there as
well what was it coming you know from
that room Stanley Cup Championship room
to then coming in a team that's a
rebuild still has some great veteran
presents and some Superstars and Kanan
tased but for you just adjusting to a
completely new culture team when did you
start to feel pretty comfortable yeah it
was actually pretty easy for me when I
first came here last year I knew Alex
and Dylan and Mackenzie and also Tyler
Johnson so it was kind of knew some some
familiar faces and and friends and I
feel like it was uh like I said it was
easy transition and I feel like all the
guys have since I came here have been
have been great it's been a it's been a
lot of fun and
um yeah I feel like just even with with
Canon Taves there are two guys that are
have been around forever and they're uh
pretty easy to to come to the rink with
every day and get along with so it's I
feel like just the whole room and in
general has been uh it's been great and
even coming in this year with the new
guys we got it's it's been a lot of fun
we've had
some good times some some bad times with
with the way the seasons went but I feel
like um throughout it we've we've all uh
been pretty close throughout the whole
process of it and and uh even just
coming to the rink every day still it's
it's we're all having fun and enjoying
it and and uh keep wanting to grow grow
together on and off the ice
Taylor have you thought at all about
off-season training will you head back
to Toronto will you stay in Chicago for
the summer Chicago's a great summer town
this is my my Shameless plug for Chicago
in the summer yeah I've uh I've always
went back home to to train back there
and I know uh everyone's been talking to
me how how nice Chicago was in the
summer I've never never experienced it
just last year when I came here I was
just sitting in the hotel for a month
when I for the rest of the season so I
didn't really have a place and but now
that I I got a spot in Chicago I'm sure
I'll I'll be back a few times and get to
check it out in the warmer weather and
yeah but I'll probably go back and forth
for most of it and just uh
come come down for a couple weeks here
and there and just kind of experience
the summertime here
Chicago easy to get back and forth maybe
easier than Tampa I can't say I know the
the if there are direct flights from
Tampa to Toronto but
all right I'm sure you get asked this
question a lot and I'm sorry to be the
last person to ask you but your fiance
her name is is also Taylor so how do you
sort that out I mean does one of you get
Tay and the other gets Taylor or you
know how have you ironed out the the
communication yeah we just she goes by
Tay and I go by tea and it's kind of
hard when you're in that kind of hard
for when you're in the public and people
call you Taylor and Taylor but I feel
like at home it's been it's been pretty
easy for us because I've always went by
tea and she's always went by taste so
it's kind of it's uh that way it's been
easy but like I said when we're in
public and someone says Taylor we're
both looking and yeah we gotta figure
out what we're gonna do here for for
documents and stuff when like for for
the future coming up because just uh
someone's got to change something I
think
maybe you could keep her maiden name
just for the sake of clarity I mean yeah
who that's that's a good point but it's
got to be are you at the eye roll Point
yet where you know every time people
find out I'm sure they they oh you guys
have the same name it's it's actually
funny when you go to when I came to
Chicago with our first time or meet
people for the first time it's so I was
like I didn't tell her this is my fiance
Taylor and they're like what they kind
of give you like a stun die like
seriously but it's it's uh yeah it's a I
think it's funny it's it's uh the way it
is for us and it's and uh it doesn't
bother us so as long as long as we're
happy with it we don't care it's it's
the way it should be so it's been it's
been fun
what if you have a son would would
Taylor Jr be uh
no I can't do that you gotta gotta or a
dog yeah that works for both so maybe we
gotta get rid of the tea I think we'll
change it right up
[Laughter]
Taylor thanks a lot for doing this we
really appreciate it uh you know Kaylee
obviously had had tracked your career
from her time in Tampa but uh it's been
great having you on the team
congratulations on establishing yourself
in the NHL you know certainly you can
statistically you can point to uh you
know your numbers this year are are
higher than they were last year and
um you know you've been uh working and
grinding your way to this point so
congratulations happy birthday and and
lots of continued luck and success in
the future we really appreciate it yeah
thank you so much for having me it was
fun
all right it's time now for sellies and
chirps you know the drill by now but in
case it's your first time watching the
Blackhawks Insider podcast the three of
us bring a discussion point to the group
and invite the others to either
celebrate it or chirp it
guys Super Bowl Sunday is one of my
favorite days of the year so to continue
the the Super Bowl discussion that we've
had already on this show I would love to
address the Super Bowl Halftime Show
featuring Rihanna
and I'll just come out and say that I
loved it I thought it was fabulous I
understand that it maybe didn't have the
Grandeur of
last year's Super Bowl halftime show or
Super Bowl halftime shows with
comparable acts Beyonce Super Bowl
halftime show comes to mind but I
thought it was true to Rihanna's style
and it was just uh we were talking about
this before we we started the show Colby
just a good way to remember how many
bangers Rihanna had so I know my
broadcast partner Troy Murray was on the
opposite side of this argument he hated
the Super Bowl halftime show I think
highlighting the generation gap as much
as anything else but what did you guys
think
I loved it bad girl Riri she crushed it
yeah yeah I mean I loved it I love the
red belly for being pregnant I thought
um she came out hot and crushed it so
like you said it wasn't it was different
I don't really look at Super I can't
compare Super Bowl performances I just
think they're so different depending on
the artist and it kind of has to make
sense with the venue and
time and everything like I thought JLo
and Shakira did a great job when they
United together last year was one of my
favorite all time even though a lot of
people didn't like it I thought the
throwback and what they did and 50 Cent
dropping down like a bat was
unreal and nostalgic for a lot of people
so this year I thought it was just crazy
too she hasn't had a concert or
performed in so long because she's been
doing um doing like Fenty beauty and
fashion and and makeup and crushing it
that way so I thought this was really
really good it seemed like all the
feedback both male and female were kind
of in favor of her she did a great job
yeah so Kaylee I I did want to just ask
um is it true that you dropped a bad
girl Riri
name drop on a Blackhawks radio
broadcast with John wiedeman did that
actually happen oh it happened we gotta
clip that one John was like you got
Eagles or Chiefs and I said bad girl
Riri and I think he almost lost it on
the spot so he's not a Riri fan to my
knowledge
um hopefully he is after last night but
yeah I don't I don't know if he knew
what I was talking about
well he uh he's definitely a Chiefs fan
we know that and and I assume when you
said bad girl Riri he was thinking you
were talking he was thinking you were
talking in a different language I think
there's uh probably a little bit of that
uh that Gap you were talking about
between you and Troy Chris is probably
right there with with Kaylee and Johnny
Weideman but I'm with you too like I I
really thought that um Rihanna did a
nice job and the thing is is that um I'm
not the like Rihanna's not like I you
know I didn't see her being picked to do
the show and getting super excited about
it like I did last year you know I
thought last year was unbelievable with
all of the you know the Nostalgia and I
think like 50 Cent and Dr Dre I mean it
was just like all of our probably
hip-hop favorites and I will say the
biggest takeaway for me was kind of a
reminder of like how many nights that I
was out in college and we were at a
place and Rihanna song came on and
everybody got really excited and it was
like oh yeah I forgot about that song oh
yeah I forgot about that song so yeah
probably not the same level of dancing
and and Showmanship as like Shakira and
JLo but hey that's not Rihanna's style
she stayed true to it there's a reason
she's performing at the halftime of the
Super Bowl she's obviously big time so
I'm I'm certainly uh certainly not
chirping it at all I thought that uh it
was a job well done
and I think it went with the game I
think the game was good the halftime was
good and I don't think there's much to
complain about when it comes to the
Super Bowl I mean I except if you ask
most Eagles fans they're they're pretty
bitter today so tough day tough yeah Fly
Eagles Fly for sure and and I guess
staying with that topic you know of
football and of the Super Bowl which is
kind of where my cellular cheer up goes
is you know I'm I'm wondering how the
city of Chicago feels about Matt Nagy
getting a Super Bowl ring I mean he was
here with the Bears
I don't think people here liked him very
much I I the sentiment about Matt Nagy
was not great while uh he was here but
for me I'm not chirping it I'm not a
Bears fan and I'm not from here so I
guess I don't have the same level of
emotion towards it but I would compare
it for me towards you know what I was
happy that Andy Reid won another Super
Bowl Andy Reid was the coach of the
Eagles my entire childhood he's the
winningest coach of the Eagles all time
they did not win a Super Bowl with him
but they were right there they were good
every year he was always a classy guy
felt like he represented the team in the
city well so I you know like there was a
little silver lining in it for me I I
really was I was happy that that he won
again I think he's one of the best NFL
coaches
um there ever was and so I'm gonna
celebrate Matt Nagy getting the Super
Bowl ring I don't think many of our fans
will appreciate that or agree with me on
that one uh but Kaylee what are you
thinking there I mean you're from
Chicago you've you've been pretty close
to the NFL for a long time so you might
have a an interesting take on this yeah
I I don't know if it's interesting but
thank you
I'm not gonna like chirp somebody else
having success when they've moved on and
I'm not a die-hard Bears fan obviously
with my husband having played in the
league I was a fan of him and whatever
team he played for so Bears fans are
going to be Bears fans go Petco I see
that right there Fosters
um sorry Chicago fans but
um I I all celebrate it I mean he he won
and sure he didn't have a great run here
in in the eyes of a lot of Bears fans
but I I'm not gonna knock somebody else
for having success when they've moved on
to another team and who knows maybe this
uh works well for him and he gains a lot
of valuable experience and is able to do
things moving on in his career that he
wasn't able to do in Chicago so I'm
going to celebrate it
I I thought that Matt and Aggie really
crushed the pr point of the situation
when he was asked during Super Bowl
media day about his time in Chicago and
and he praised quarterback Justin fields
and said that he thinks he's going to be
a really good NFL player over the course
of his career so credit Matt Nagy for
for taking The High Ground there yeah
I'll celebrate that I don't think I
don't think it it's beyond the capacity
for Chicago Bears fans to you know feel
good for Matt Nagy that he won a a Super
Bowl as an assistant I mean he came from
Kansas City had a lot that that was what
made him an attractive head coaching
candidate for the Bears in the first
place I think it would be much different
if Matt Nagy had gone on to be the head
coach of another team and was vying for
a Super Bowl because he didn't have the
success in Chicago that Andy Reid had in
in Philadelphia before moving to his
next head coaching destination so I I
think given given the circumstances yeah
I'll celebrate this but if they were a
little bit tweaked I'm not sure that
that Bears fans would be so magnanimous
so my celebration in chirps not specific
to the Super Bowl but it made me think
of it a lot because all the cameras and
phones and I saw like Brittany Mahomes
right next to Patrick with her phone the
whole time and that's kind of what you
see when you look at highlights and him
holding the trophy up and you see like
her phone and everyone's phone so my
question that LeBron James picture went
viral and it was him becoming the
all-time points leader in the NBA and
every single person in the photo had
their phone out I mean it's very crazy
looking when you just look at it and I'm
not like a dinosaur I'm not against
filming it I think it's cool like I like
having when Ovechkin scored his 800th
goal I liked having a picture of me
there because I was like that's where I
was in the building you know of myself
but I'm not gonna go take a picture of
OV necessarily like from the Press Box
level to have on my phone there's a
million other pictures so long story
short are you celebrating are you
chirping being in the moment and putting
your phone away for a moment like what
LeBron James had or Mahomes lifting the
trophy or are you getting your phone out
and snapping every pic you can
I've gone back and forth on this
personally and and as a fan you know
I've tried to be at times be both at
times I've tried to be a fan who's just
solely in the moment
as it happens and not watching it
through a cell phone screen because
sometimes it's like you know you catch
yourself and you're like wait a second
I'm at this event live and I'm still
watching it on a screen what am I doing
at the same time I think there is
something to be said for posterity and
remembering and having some kind of
digital record of of this event when it
happens but I I still think that the the
memory imprint
is what's it's what's going to carry you
along longer I mean you're going to
reflect on it in your head more than
you're going to like scroll through the
thousands of pictures or videos that you
have on your phone to try and then
relive that memory so what about a
concert specifically
I don't know concerts I guess are long
enough where you can record clips and
yeah I don't know and still enjoy it
without your phone as an interface but I
I guess I'm gonna chirp this and and
still you know not to sound like uh I
get off my lawn guy but I I've been
there I've done it but
I do it but like you know I don't know
like I think there's something to be
said for just for just being uh being in
the moment at least have the phone off
to the side like you know then you can
then you then you do look like a get off
your lawn guy if you're going like this
do not do that
well Kaylee I think the first thing you
said was kind of interesting because
you're like well I maybe I take a
picture of me there to document that and
less about actually filming the moment
and and I think that that's kind of a
cool take on it because I'm also going
to chirp this I'm first and foremost bad
at this because like I just don't think
oh let me get my phone to document this
um it's it happens to me with
photographs it's happened to me with big
Sports moments and my own personal CR I
mean I've just never been quick to be
like let me get my phone out and and get
pictures of this so
um I think you gotta sit there and and
you're there at the game like if you
wanted it on your phone you could have
just stayed home and and watched it on
TV and then taken the clip off of
Twitter from someone of the million
people that are posting the same things
so I just thought it was really
interesting the picture you're talking
about Kaylee when they put it side by
side to when Michael Jordan had like his
or it was Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had his
everybody was sitting there are watching
and I know cell phones weren't a thing
then and I I get it it's not Apples to
Apples but I'm I'm I'm kind of with you
too I don't I don't really personally
care for that it's not something that I
personally would do or even think to do
um like my wife is a lot better about
getting her phone out and being like Oh
let's get a picture of this let's
document this and like I'm sure
um I'll get better at it especially you
know with things you know changing and
adding family members and this and that
but but yeah I'm kind of old school in
the thought that like you can't
replicate living that moment being there
with that moment I mean when you're
sitting around with your friends now
talking about things that happened
when we were in middle school or high
school when we didn't have iPhones yet
at that point I mean we might have had
cell phones but they certainly didn't
have the capabilities that they have now
we laughed just as hard telling a story
about something stupid my friend did in
the lunchroom when we were in seventh
grade that we do if there's a picture of
something from a bachelor party five
years ago so I think you can never
replicate the memory and I do think it's
it's kind of part of our problem in
society is like the screens like
everyone is in is is with the screen at
all time I'm guilty of it whenever my
screen time comes up on my cell phone on
Sunday night there are days where I'm
like oh my God like I don't want anyone
to know this this is horrifying so
um chirping it uh with you completely I
think if you want you get your picture
of you there in the moment and that way
it's like kind of about you for the for
the future you know so yeah I I don't
want to be a get off my lawn person
either but if I got if that's all I got
to be if that's all I gotta be and
that's how I gotta be
I guess I guess let's end on a positive
note I don't think you can make a wrong
decision I mean if if you take the phone
out then you've got it you better anyway
and uh if not then you then then you can
say that you were the one person in the
in the crowd that didn't I don't know
what do you think about that Kayla is
that a good way to end it
yeah I think that's a good one I like
how you summed it usually we're going
like we're heated by the end of my
cellular chirp so I like the ending on
this one you're the you're you're the
you just sit there and you're like how
can I just stir the pot the selling
chirps
I didn't have a a stir one this week but
I think it's a good good conversation to
have every time
totally that that was a great cellular
chirp per usual Kaylee
thank you with that
go ahead Colby I was gonna say we might
just have to give Kaylee the segment and
just start letting her run Sally's in
church because hers are so much more
thought-provoking I feel like uh we
always we always have a much stronger
discussion Point around around Kaylee's
so I'll think about it
Own It Kaylee own it thank you

Dylan Gambrell,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2NG86AfA04,"not happy with the end result but what'd
you see from this game that uh kept you
well gutsy effort by the guys I I
thought we played hard we had plenty of
chances
um you know we made two mistakes on on
88 and he scores on both
in the first the five on three that you
had the opportunities on maybe
yeah for sure it did but a lot of times
that can derail and it didn't you know
certainly you know we would love to have
that back you know in a tight game like
this but you can't let it affect the
rest of the game which I didn't think it
did I I thought we played hard that's a
you know that's a really good team we
had our chances I thought we checked
really hard
um you know Mando was really good just
at the end of the day the the mistakes
couple mistakes we made you know ended
up on our net confidence building though
when you see a young goaltender in just
his second game against the team like
this play the way he did yeah for sure
he looked confident the goaltending has
not been an issue you know I thought our
D did a good job I thought Hammond had
one of his better games he was really
competitive him and him and shabby when
they played together uh played really
well and he was competitive he didn't
give anything
um you know shabby you know played a ton
of minutes and played hard really he's
not a whole lot of guys you're going to
look down on yeah you want to win the
game but again it's one of the best
teams in the league coach what do you
think of Dylan gambrell's game today
that first goal doesn't happen
is hustle and then almost pots one of
his own oh he did a great job did a
great job on our penalty kill you know
that's been one of the best power plays
for the last 10 years in the league our
penalty kill was outstanding gambi's one
of those guys and he just continues to
work never says the word gives you an
honest effort every night
with this game so far and especially in
2023 well I mean he's a dynamic guy
that's competitive I mean I rely on in
all situations penalty kill power play
every scenario face-offs you know and
that's a tough tough challenge I mean
they get last chance they got their best
deal against them they got their top
line out against them you know and every
night he's dangerous for us
what'd you think about gauche's debut
today I thought he was good you know
unfair to him he never had a practice
with us systems line mates everything
that goes with it but I thought he
skated well carried the puck got a
couple shots so he'll continue to play
more minutes as you know we got a week
of practice here
Travis despite the outcome here I'm
guessing that you're pretty pretty
satisfied with how your team played
against this number one team well I mean
hate to be the one to say it but you're
never going to be satisfied obviously
with the loss um understand your
question yeah um you know tough back to
back uh really difficult building to
come into historically no matter where
that team is in the standings the number
one team in the league so we feel like
we've played them really strong
obviously all season
um
and it was a good good game for us this
afternoon
um just a couple chances ended up going
in the back of our net but we felt like
we were right there with them uh for I
don't know 55 minutes or so
um
we just it's a process got to build on
it yeah I was just gonna say certainly a
positive step in the process of trying
to get to where they are yeah of course
um we've been playing some really hockey
as of late and uh you know I've said it
throughout the year when games haven't
gone our way you you digest it and you
move forward
um and after last night's game it was no
different after this afternoon's game
it's going to be no different as well we
did a lot of really good things we know
that but at this time of the year and
moral victories don't really count we'll
take the positives out of the game and
uh to your to your question your comment
yeah it's it's a process for us and we
we got to keep the ball moving and the
ball rolling in the positive direction
which we feel like it really has been as
of late so that's all we can do now is
look forward to the next back-to-back
games we got coming up
Travis really physical game here today I
think you guys had 34 hits and 18 block
shots they say that was part of the the
plan coming into today yeah we uh you
know some some ranks in the league I
don't know they seem like they're kind
of smaller or tighter and for me anyway
historically this has always been a rink
that it feels like everyone's right on
top you and there's not a lot of space
so it's always going to be a physical
game out there they're they're a big
team they they grind you down low they
they can really uh press you below the
Face-Off circles in in your defensive
zone so we we have to be physical and I
think we're up for that challenge uh
tonight on on our side and we knew that
we had to get in some lanes and help
Mando
um any chances we had and he played a
great game tonight I mean that's uh it's
a really tough uh back to back and a
situation for him to come in and he
played exceptional so that's another big
positive for our group you guys got a
first hand look at what a first place
team looks like oh yeah absolutely
um you know I thought we we hung in
there great and um like you said you
know that's a team that's that plays the
right way every night in a night in and
night out and you know they just they do
the little things and I think
um you know we kept kept up with them
great on a on a back to back but we can
take away you know a lot from their game
I was just going to say a pretty
positive step in the process of hanging
with teams like this right yeah for sure
you know I think we're playing a good
game right now too and yeah you know we
just stick with it keep doing the little
details and you know keep the confidence
up and we're playing good hockey
so now your guys's goal doesn't happen
today without you know the hustle you
put in on that play to flip the puck
back to Brady um can you tell us what's
going through your mind on a play like
that uh just trying to work to get the
get the puck back a couple guys changing
staying out there the extra second just
to you know keep him in their Zone but
um
you know it was a great finish I'm
assuming you're liking where your game
is at right now personally yeah I think
it's just a day by day thing
um you know trying to get better every
single day staying patient too that's a
big thing too so day by day staying
patient and then and just keep working
to help the boys out Travis just
finished saying this was a despite the
outcome pretty positive step in the
process of trying to get to a team like
to be like a team like Boston yeah
they're best in the league for a reason
so
um
you know for us to kind of hang in there
a little couple details that end up in
the back of that but uh for the most
part we're almost kind of punch and
punch with them for uh you know for most
of the game
a physical game from start to finish
here was that part of the game plan
just want to leave it all out there we
knew we had you know four days off here
and or however many to our next game so
we just wanted to leave all out there
and
yeah I mean it's uh
those are you know big games for us and
I know it's you know big game for them
too it's uh they know oh and we both
know like the records this year of you
know against each other and then of
course you know we're up against them
who's you know best best in league so
that was motivation for us and then
um that's confidence that uh a lot of
times we dictated the way we wanted to
play but uh yeah they're a great team
um but it's always a fun atmosphere to
come we use the word confidence on our
broadcast and talking about your 22 year
old goaltender this afternoon straight
again and it's a huge huge saves for us
both him and so give and awesome for us
so
um yeah we just try to eliminate our
chances again tonight and uh no he
stopped the door tonight it's on some
pretty big plays what'd you see from uh
Julian gauche here today in his debut I
made a lot of no great players out there
of course it's got to be no different a
weird kind of adjustment being you know
new team new systems all in less than 24
hours so um I thought he you know looked
good out there he made a lot of plays
and you see the power in this game"

Markus Niemelainen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1RHdy-3bKY,"marcus over the last few games your ice
time has gone up and you have a little
bit more responsibility can you just let
us know where your confidence level is
at with your game uh
pretty good i i think i've played pretty
well and
it's uh
it's nice to get a bit more responsible
in morris time so
yeah what are the things that you feel
like you're doing well
um
i think i'm
defending pretty well and then uh
just trying to keep it simple i guess
with the puck so
obviously a big part of your game is
being physical
uh were you were you always physical
growing up or is that something that you
kind of had to add to your game
no i
i kind of had to
add that to my game to uh
it's uh the guys are so skilled here so
i can't really be a skilled player here
so
i have to do something else so did you
start doing that when you started
playing pro or was it just before major
junior or uh maybe more when i started
playing
pro hockey so
what
take us to the element of a hit you seem
so good at closing the gap like are you
just kind of waiting for them to make
the first move or are you like leading
them into a certain area maybe take us
through what goes on in your head uh
well
just
kind of read the situation i guess it's
you can't do it and do it all the time
otherwise it'll be
will be out of the play but
but i'll try to read it a bit to
think where the puck might go and then
so 14th nhl game last game uh and you go
up against the back-to-back stanley cup
champions
when you're going up with against guys
like kucharov stamkos who have been so
good for so long do you look forward to
that does that get you excited yeah it's
fun fun to play against those guys it's
they're uh
they're so skilled and good players that
you really have to be aware when they're
on the ice
and in terms of communicating with other
defensemen you have veterans you have
darnell nurse tyson barry just to name a
few how much do you try to talk to them
in order to learn from them uh
a little bit i'm a
bit maybe quiet on the locker room so
uh but i'll try to
see what they're doing and
try to
improve my game from and learn from them
and working with dave matson what's that
been like i know you had him in
bakersfield start of the year as well
but now that he's here what's some of
the feedback he's kind of given you and
what's he like as a coach uh
just a lot of small detailed stuff and
and
yeah he's he's helped me a lot improve
my game
how big is the jump for defenseman from
the american league to the national
hockey league
um
look the guys passed the puck so well
it's
it's uh i think that's the biggest
difference
and uh you have to be aware on the ice
all the time so
yeah they're really good players here
and speaking of aware whenever a
goaltender like mike smith gets the puck
what's the communication like there you
have to be a little bit more alert when
because he's so good at playing the puck
right yeah he's really good with playing
the puck uh
i don't know i've talked with him a bit
it's a bit
really hard used to it that the goal is
so
involved with the puck but it's i think
it's really good she's like a
third defenseman out there so helps us"
William Lockwood,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1PVaE-w_kE,"it just felt like all game one fell like
your feet were really moving well how
did you feel
yeah um
you know feet were moving you know the
effort was there
um you know execution we got a lot of
guys missing so
um step up wanted to execute a little
bit more out there but um you know put a
lot of put a lot of effort into that one
i think i've talked to you since you had
an a on your chest what does that mean
to be able to wear that
yeah you know it's a
it's a great honor when i walked in um
you know
it was it was great to see i was uh you
know i think a lot of guys on the team
probably could have substituted in for
some of the guys that are up uh with van
right now so um you know it's an honor
to have that on on my jersey um but like
i said we got a lot of leaders in the
group looked like you almost kind of
like i said i've had a half step on
everyone tonight
do you feel like your game's at a point
right now where you're really happy with
like kind of as a guy who needs to
develop and get towards that step
towards taking the nhl do you feel like
that's happened this season i guess yeah
absolutely i think it's coming along um
you know i think there's a lot of room
to grow still um but you know working
away at it and and getting there and
you know starting to feel confident in
that
uh trent just show us a screenshot of
four guys on the ice what'd you think of
a call at the end there
yeah you know it's uh
that that type of stuff happens and you
know it's a tough way to lose a game
obviously but
um
you know you see that kind of stuff all
the time so it's it's we can't get too
down about it
you're going up against this team again
tomorrow night it's a big strong team
out there this i mean there's a lot of
physicality in that game how excited you
guys get back
tomorrow
yeah everyone that's kind of what the
message was
right after the game
kind of put that one behind us i think
um like i said like the effort was there
and um guys
you know it was good positivity in the
locker room after even though um you
know we went out that way but
um like you said it's nice that we get
them
kill it was in the tomorrow or third
period you had a really good poke check
to kind of get the puck down the ice
there how do you feel like your penalty
killings gone from the start of the year
to this point now i know you've been
able to do it in the past but it just
feels like you're like the first winger
out there a lot of times it seems like
coach is trusting you a lot more it's
good yeah it's um you know
it's it's nice that he's got confidence
in me to to be on the pk consistently
and um you know that's something
you know i take a lot of pride in like
i've said before but um you know i use
my feet to to get a little extra step
and being aggressive it's uh i think
that goes a long way
we put out three players in overtime
there yourself rathbone drives uh how
confident you feel in that group of
three guys you have the leading scorer
you got rathbones obviously when the top
defense within yourself with all the
speed like how confident
yeah it's exciting going over the boards
with those guys
you know it's it's fun to play with
players like that and
a lot of attributes out there between
the three of us and you know it's
unfortunate we didn't um you know put
that one away you got a good view of
putting someone on i know you're on
skates but basically
did you see that little move
yeah you know it didn't it doesn't
surprise me too much he does that kind
of stuff in practice all the time and i
kind of expect it in the games but um
it's good to see that he's playing with
a lot of confidence right now what does
he add to this group right now i know
obviously without the injury he looked
like a really bad injury he comes back
you know not as long as maybe some
people would have expected him adding to
this
um
you know he's a great guy to have in the
locker room first of all so it's it's
good to have him back and in the mix and
everything um but he brings you know a
lot of speed he's he's you know our
quarterback on the power play snaps
pucks uh he brings that offensive side
and
at the same time he's very reliable in
d-zone um did you ever cross paths with
nick blankenburg in michigan was he
there yeah yeah he looks like he's about
to be signed with an hl team what do you
think
i think what two years with him maybe or
one year uh yeah we were together for
two years yeah
because he's really ripped it up oh yeah
he's he's having a great year it's um
you know that's a kid who's
you know worked his way
um for everything and you know to see
him having success is is great we're
actually living together this summer so
you know we're trying to find a place
right now but um
so i always you know i'm checking in on
him seeing how he's doing seeing him
score
and all these goals it's great to see so
what do you think of people saying he's
too small
and they're he's he's been told that his
entire life and like he came on i think
he
you know
has a walk-on or low scholarship and now
he's a captain of team and
you know has
i don't know 13 goals or something like
that as a defenseman
so
it's it's no surprise to me and
you know i think he's going to continue
to grow and
develop on that michigan team much it
seems like they're going to go on a deep
breath
in that first playoff game yeah
absolutely i i'm always checking out
them seeing how they're doing i got a
lot of good friends on the team even
some of the guys i haven't played with
i'm good friends with so
um it's good to see them doing so well
well um i do have a question um
so
coach has talked about a lot about
opportunity for the secondary guys how
does it feel to really have first first
five minutes with all the all the big
guys go up today and they jump it's good
yeah it's uh an opportunity
um i think a lot of guys are trying to
take advantage right now including
myself and
um you know
that type of stuff happens throughout
the year so it's it's good to see guys
stepping in i know we had a lot of guys
kind of coming in and play a nice role
tonight with uh missing some big pieces
on the team so
um
that's good it's everyone you know has
got each other's back out there
realizing we're missing some guys but
you know i think tonight's show we have
a lot of depth"
Vitaly Abramov,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amvxCE584JE,"talk a little bit just I just asked your
coach about this you know you guys have
had an up-and-down kind of season so far
but to put together a dominant win last
night against Binghamton and then and
then to come in the Lehigh Valley and
play the way that you did tonight what's
been the turnaround for this team well
it was a huge win for us on the road
like second game it's always hard but we
found a way to win of course it helps
like us I don't know I think it just
played more structured and work harder
than in the beginning of the season and
works out well for us does it help to
when Gustafson had a had a huge game
tonight really swallowing pucks no big
rebounds that kind of thing I'm sure
that helps everybody in front of him as
well well for sure ENS is a good goal
and he had a really good game and he
made a little safe so yeah he's a big
part of our win tonight ever since the
rookie show case we've been really
impressed with your game talk just a
little bit about your style and the
things that you are most proud of that
you bring to the game well I like to
play on the high speed like make plays
and just work hard work hard and you
know help the team to win the season
overall as I said has some ups and downs
what's been the the big thing for you
just going in fresh every game and
trying to put the last game behind you
and get that win yeah go every day on
the practice on the game and work hard
like I said again and I know just play
my game and yeah help the team to win we
we cover LaValle most often you guys see
them 12 times a year they're coming into
town on Wednesday what's what's kind of
the prep for playing against Lavelle
because it's always kind of a grudge
match between the two of you for sure we
play a lot of games against them they're
in our division and well we know them
well and it's always like a small
adjustments after the last game like
game review and then then just go and
play first off let's just talk a little
bit about your first few games with
Belleville how's it feel to be back in
the American League yeah it's great to
be back it's been a little while but
it's good to be back and that
got a pretty good group here and there's
some opportunity so just trying to take
advantage of it right now we were just
talking about ago about your you've been
getting power play time already which is
which is a unique opportunity to make
kind of a name for yourself it feels
good yeah I mean it's power play down in
South Carolina has been pretty good so
far
so I've been getting a lot of reps down
there so I feel pretty comfortable out
here now on just a matter of just kind
of executing we got it we got a good
unit there right now so hopefully we can
keep cashing it had to be a pleasant
surprise to hear that you're gonna call
up to the American League yeah it was
nice yeah I mean this is kind of what I
came back for so it's good to be back
and I get to be back in these buildings
and it's exciting right now so tell me
just briefly for people who may be not
following you the last couple years
since you left the the Canadiens
organization where were you last year
yeah so I was in New York I was working
in banking actually the last eight
months and then kind of towards the end
of the summer I realized that this you
know this is I needed to be back I
didn't want to have regrets tone down
the line and had a couple imbalance
throughout the last year but was never
fully ready and I think towards the end
of the summer I kind of got that it's
that I needed to jump on it before it
was gone forever so yeah it's just it's
it's been quite a whirlwind and I can't
say I've expected much of anything last
six months but it's good to be back
what's the biggest is there an
adjustment you had that year off are you
are you feeling like you still need to
get in the game condition are you
feeling like your body's there and I
feel good I mean I feel pretty good the
legs feel good I mean I think I started
off really well and in the East Coast
League with with South Carolina and then
it's just a matter of just the pace here
is a little bit higher obviously so just
getting used to that in different
teammates and different systems kind of
like an information overload the first
couple days here got here Wednesday so
that's you know that's all part of it
but I feel good and hopefully I mean
mental breaks and get always a good
thing in the body's uh knocking on what
holding up so far so your last season
with the Canadiens organization was that
inaugural season LaValle which was
pretty poor for everyone involved was it
was it hard to get over having a season
like that yeah I mean I think it beat up
a lot of guys throughout the summer
didn't put any one individually in great
positions
and it didn't allow really guys to kind
of continue to move forward and and with
great opportunities quite frankly so I
mean I'm one example there's a couple
others on the team that also kind of
actually stopped playing and then you
can just see that it's you know team
successes it's very dependent on you
know on the individuals as well and vice
versa so it's it's it's one-on-one and
clearly we didn't have the team success
which which hurt everyone involved
coach is included you're now on a team
that plays Laval twelve times a year and
you get to see them on Wednesday what's
that gonna be like for ya it's different
I think when I found out I looked at the
schedule and kind of started chuckling
because it's just kind of comes full
circle I guess and I know a couple guys
are still on that team it charlie'll
Ingrid's still really good buddy of mine
and McCarran and those guys so I keep in
touch with them so it'll be pretty funny
to look over the red line and see those
guys again hopefully Charlie that's my
foot one hand and be nice hopefully a
little friendly fight yeah yeah exactly
we'll see it yeah I'll see what happens
as a new addition to your roster tell me
what you he's contributed on the point
sheet already tell me what you've seen
in the first few games you've had with
him and what you've been impressed with
our philosophy is to go to Brampton
first avi CHL affiliate but you know
what Chandra is pretty much out for the
season and we we took two guys already
so just you know from my former contacts
in the ECHL and from some research from
our personnel you know Tom well we were
told tom was the best best option out
there and I know that from talking to
his coaches South Carolina he's off to a
heck of a start and we needed a puck
mover we do lost our power play guys
with Murray with a broken finger and
lush whap so we wanted to get a puck
mover that could potentially play on our
power play and for two games I think
he's been very very good and it's nice
to also that he had like 147 AHL games
you know that always helps that there's
nothing you're not breaking in a raw
rookie so you know as long as we got
some options with some injuries we're
gonna give it an opportunity and see
where it takes us
you"
Adam Fox,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phh-4Ncpf7I,"Weird first period to disallow
goals, and then
obviously their goal that,
you know, took some time to
review two
and then I think it just became
a little too running gun.
I think, you know, we were
getting a lot of good looks and
but equally giving up a lot of
good looks. So
just just lost that tightness.
We had and dug. Ourself
a little too deep of a whole.
What do you feel like
a differences were between what
you guys are able to do so,
effectively
last game versus tonight?
I think definitely limit the,
the great a chances, I think.
I'm coming off the rush and
get good. Looks and
some odd man rushes and
Breakaway here and there. So
now you give team enough chances
like that they're going
to capitalize so
yeah I thought it just got away
from us
like I said, after that first
period was a little weird,
seems to lose our Rhythm a
little bit
in the way that you guys are
able to put something together
in the third period is feel like
you can build on that
going back home. Yeah, like I
said, I thought we had
a lot of chances
especially in that third period,
even in the second.
I thought we had a lot of good,
looks
how they just got some,
some big saves and then
now they get one and you kind of
kill your momentum a little
bit but
overall just gotta tighten it up
but we had a lot of good
looks as well.
Adam
knows, it was
it was weird and
like I said, it seemed like the
game kinda little wonky from
their kind of lost a rhythm and,
you know, I think we kind of
lost our Rhythm a little bit
and
thought. But yeah, it was a
weird first period for sure."

Cam Dineen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIMYAnYItA4,"camden een a 21 year old Tom's urban
Edith a high school North alumni and a
2016 NHL draft day by the Arizona
coyotes is here to talk about how you go
into hockey in a town where this sport
was not very big but beginning to grow
he discusses how he got to where he is
today in this sport and how his first
professional season went he was
committed to play hockey at Yale
University before choosing to play in
the Ontario Hockey League for the North
Bay battalion and losing his NCAA
Eligibility during his final season he
was traded to the Sarnia Sting mid
season this past year you played in his
first professional season with the
Tucson Roadrunners the American Hockey
League affiliate of the Arizona coyotes
welcome thanks for having me so when did
you start playing hockey I started when
I was about three years old my dad got
me on the ice pretty young age then just
did the learning to skate clinic stuff
like that and then around 5:00 or so I
started on my first team which was Tom
for Blackhawks here so would you say
there's like a specific moment that
stands out to when you realized he could
actually do something in this sport I'd
say just like officially signing to the
OHL with North Bay I think that was a
pretty big moment and then playing that
first season with them was a kind of a
stepping stone and I opener for me the
OHL is a really good lead with a lot of
highly touted players so I mean to go in
there and have a good first season like
I did that I kind of showed me and gave
me some confidence that I could do
something what would you say like really
made you decide to sign to the OHL
instead of going to Yale University it's
a pretty long process disgusted with my
agent family and at the end of the day I
think going into my draft year which was
that year i am i had to pick what was
best what was going to develop me the
most i think
north been playing for the battalion was
the best option and I mean they play in
the OHL so it's the best junior league
and in the world how is it living away
from home with the age of 17 it was an
adjustment for sure I mean it was tough
to to move in with another family and
adjust all that but the family I lived
with was awesome I still keep in touch
with them today and they really helped
me and helped me on and off the ice so I
mean they just made it easy what is your
favorite memory in your OHL career I'd
say just getting traded to Sanya that
happened in my final season and there's
pretty cool ego to a good team and have
a have a chance to win the OHL
unfortunately we didn't but that was
that was a cool moment to go there and
play with some other real good any job
prospects so that was really cool so
what was your first reaction when you
heard that you got traded to star you I
was pretty surprised I was and wasn't
too sure if and when or where I was
going to get traded but I knew there was
a chance and I mean I'm glad I was
Sarnia they had a really good team and
the coaches were great there and I think
that kind of helped push me along my
development but yeah that overall
experience was great how is the NHL
draft experience when in 2016 when you
were there it was awesome I was there
with family friends everyone so I mean
that was great that they were all there
to experience that with me and I mean
just sitting there and waiting to hear
my name be called it I mean I honestly
don't even really remember it it went by
super quick but super slow at the same
time but all in all I mean it was a
great experience and I mean that's just
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity so how
do you think the transition from the OHL
to the American Hockey League was for
you I think it was an adjustment I
started the year I struggled with some
things just get my confidence and
everything like that but I think as the
season went on I earned my my playing
time and I think
I got better game-by-game practice by
practice so I think the coaches there
recognize that and I think towards the
the end the second half of the season I
I finished really strong so it should be
good going back in so how would you say
you think your rookie season what I
think it was good like I just said I
think I had a really good second half I
think when I when I did play at the
start I did well but just grew as the
year went on and I think worked on a lot
of stuff but the coaches there and it'll
be good to get back with them and keep
working with them um so what is your
offseason training look like right now
it's just worked out five six times a
week go to All Star Sports Academy here
in Toms River it's a good place good
trainers there and I've worked there for
a couple years now when I'm home so they
they do a good job and they know what
what I need to be doing and usually once
a week it'll be a track day so some type
of conditioning day those are usually
pretty tough are there any specific
things you're working on this offseason
for the upcoming season yeah I mean I
think first and foremost just getting
stronger
on and off the ice I think just building
a foundation that'll put me in good
situations on the ice and be able to win
battles and stuff like that but also my
my footwork explosiveness stuff like
that my first three steps those are all
things I could get better so are you um
do you have any goals for this upcoming
season uh not so much
putting numbers on anything or anything
like that but I think just the goal - to
go in and try to be one of the the main
guys on Tucson I think that's important
I think I could take that step and then
I mean we just missed play-offs last
year by one point it came down to the
last few games so I think everyone there
would agree that we want to make the
playoffs so why would you say you miss
most about like Tom's everything Jersey
Shore a lawyer away I'd say just go on
to the beach go on their friends and
family I mean they live in a great spot
here and it's really cool to have the
beach and the river and stuff like that
so I mean all that and the summer is
real fun hey well thanks for coming
thanks for having me"
Cliff Pu,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnnD3V5g8iQ,"last season played Just 17 games for the
osua generals as Cliff Pooh and then he
was traded to the London nightes here's
a feature story on
him Cliff Pooh entered the Ontario
hockey league as a highly toted first
round pick selected 16th overall but his
first year in the ol didn't go as
planned he scored just four goals and
nine points in 41 games and was doubt
from Ashawa to London but he's putting
that year behind him and spent this
summer getting focused well this summer
I just tried to work hard and uh I think
um Dale's rewarding me a little here so
uh hopefully I can keep it up again you
know he came over he got hurt a little
bit and uh didn't really get going with
us last year but he came in this year he
was in good shape and uh and uh he's
he's worked up the lines and he's on a
pretty good role right now and so far
his hard work is paying off who is
seeing regular ice time with the Knights
like I said it's it's nice to it's nice
to contribute to the for the team and uh
hopefully as long as the team wins uh
that's all that matters part of the
credit for Pooh's play this year can be
traced back to the fact that he didn't
suit up much last season in both Ashawa
and London he got to watch and learn
from Star players each and every night
yeah you know watching watching the
games you don't want to waste an
opportunity to learn and you know we had
so many good players last year like
domes and mins and dvo and you just
watch them play and hopefully RN from
them this is a pivotal season for the
Richmond Hill L of it's his draft year
for the National Hockey League though he
doesn't like to focus on it to be honest
with you I try not to think about it but
you know it's hard not to being a big
year in that but uh I think our team's
got a lot of good prospects this year
and uh hopefully hopefully all of us can
get drafted and it certainly helped that
he has a number of teammates that are
going through the same thing when it
comes to the NHL draft Pro Scouts are
making their way to Budweiser Gardens
for almost every game yeah you well we
got some high and Prospects and uh I
think a lot of Scouts come to watch him
play and you know the other guys like me
you know we F under the radar but uh
it's nice to have the scouts at your
games all the time the slaughter there's
a they score for yeah of course uh you
know the Scouts are there and uh you
just try and play your best play your
hardest and uh play your own game and
hopefully they can they can see what
they're like but for Pooh his main goal
don't try and do too much in front of
the scope just stick to his game yeah
you don't want to change your game for
the draft you know even if you get to
the next level you're you're going to be
the same type of player but uh yeah you
just try and work hard work your hardest
and uh hopefully get the job done

J.D. Greenway,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efTyHQi0tps,"Jordan let's talk about what was working
early on this hockey game especially the
first 10 minutes the forecheck created
some great chances at that point what
were you guys doing well yeah well you
know I think early on we were we were
focused on our game plan and we executed
it well but I think we got away from it
early and that's when they started
getting their chances and we couldn't
find a way to bounce back again was
there something specific in the second
period that Columbus was able to do to
kind of change the flow of the hockey
game that was the period that kind of
dictated who won you know I don't think
there's anything they did you know it's
a great great hockey team we play I'm
not gonna take that away from but you
know I think we got to do and you know
we didn't do we had to do it for all 16
months and you know going forward that's
what we have to do it order to win games
you guys had a great first quarter of
the season you haven't had a lot of
stretches like this where you look back
you've seen a couple of games where you
wish you can have them back now you do
how important is the game Saturday
against Toronto one of the very best
teams in the league for you guys to put
60 out there
jujitsu xerus for sure we got to find a
way to bounce but I can get back on get
back on the winning side and you know I
think we'll find a way to do that
Saturday for your line you guys were
able to get that forecheck reignited in
the third period using that sighs what
you've talked about all year when pucks
aren't going in but you're getting the
zone time do you feel like it's just a
matter of time
yeah I think you know I think that's a
good start for a line you know I think
we got to build on it we got to be a lot
better you know we got a better size for
check all 60 minutes and on top of that
we got to find ways to get pucks to the
net and and get boxing than that so we
got a lot of things we've got of we got
to go back and look at and be ready to
go out Saturday appreciate your time
tonight Thanks all right Thank You
Jordan Greenway in the wild guys come up

that two-game losing streak Saturday in
downtown st. Paul early start 5:30

Jack LaFontaine,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oERg2FU9Ko,"[Music]
as a 20 year old going back to juniors
it's kind of hard to see the bigger
picture right
everything happens for a reason you know
everyone has their own destiny
and i was kind of brushing it off saying
you don't understand like i just lost a
spot at one of the greatest
college hockey programs
little did i know i was going to get
another shot at probably the best
college hockey program
in the nation 16 months later
i guess looking back on it all
reflecting it seems kind of wild to
speak of it out loud
i started playing junior hockey at age
17. i went down to janesville wisconsin
that was a year where i finally locked
up a scholarship to play for the
university of michigan
jack i think we're the first to tell you
and everyone will that he went to
michigan too young
didn't play a whole lot but we had a
very good team we made it to the frozen
four
my partner was hayden levine at the time
he was probably one of the top goalies
in the country
the stars didn't really align for me to
stick around at michigan it was agreed
upon by myself and the coaching staff
that i was gonna go back to
juniors up in british columbia
i remember sitting in that meeting with
coach pearson
he was just kind of laying the cards on
the table he was super honest with me
super up front
i was most likely never going to play
another game for the wolverines
i remember getting out of that meeting
and
crying on the staircase
[Music]
as a goal you always want to feel wanted
you always want to feel respected you
want to always want to feel like you
know you're the best option and
you know it broke my heart
[Music]
after two years in michigan he still had
eligibility play junior hockey and he
ends up back in penticton
to pick up my stuff and just go back to
junior hockey it felt like a demotion or
even a punishment
probably one of the hardest decisions
i've ever had to make in my life
it took a long time i guess mentally and
emotionally to get back to a place where
i was stable i was comfortable and once
i kind of felt like i had my groove back
beyond ice portions started to take over
i'm really close with the coach up in
penticton fred harbinson said this kid
is special he's getting older he's
getting more mature now did we know we
were going to have an all-american
hobie type goaltender no we just knew we
had a number one goalie
that competed his tail off and then when
he got here then you really got
underneath the hood
and you just watched and blossomed
lafontaine having
a year in goal to remember for minnesota
i lived with jack for a year so i know a
lot about him as a person he's always
been a guy to pay attention to the
little things i'm always one of the last
guys to leave the rink
every time i leave he's still just
getting out of the ice bath or he's
watching game film and he's taking notes
in his little notebook that he carries
around everywhere
he's pretty steady and he's a workhorse
he takes notes on the other team's power
play when penalty kill has his meetings
he sits in the front row preparing for
it
a lot of us take three four hours out of
our day to kind of focus on hockey come
to the rink practice workout and you
know he's spending five six seven hours
in the rink every single day just trying
to become a better player
great save by lafontaine there's a
chance no but lafontaine slides to his
left it's so reliable back there it's
it's super helpful for us because we can
kind of play a little bit more offense
knowing that he's back there with us
[Music]
everyone has like a specific mentality
that they need to play in and for me i
need to play with an edge i need to play
with a little bit of grit and i can feel
when it's there i can feel when it's
also not there
i still get you know knocked around a
little bit i still get you know beaten
mentally and emotionally and
you know now i know how to deal with it
better and i just know deep down that
whenever there is a negative in my life
whenever there's adversity i know that
it's going to push me forward to bigger
and better things
i think that's one of the beauties that
he doesn't have anything negative to say
about anywhere he's been and that he
just says this is his journey this
journey brought him here

Rem Pitlick,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIekuG54ZAY,"Hey Habs fans, it's Rem Pitlick.
Thanks for sending in your questions. Let's get to them.
So question number one, from Rick:
So basically, I think there was a bit of a mix-up in the article.
I'm not sure if it was lost in translation, but I'm not vegan.
I just try to eat as healthy as I can, I try to get my food, my meats, my vegetables
from good organic sources if I can.
And if I can't, I'm not going to stress about it, but I try to eat organic when I can,
and I just kind of try to pay attention to how my body feels when I eat.
So, I'm not vegan, I just try to be as healthy as possible
with the information that my body is giving me.
Next question, Philippe:
I think, definitely the biggest role model I had growing up was my dad.
He played in the NHL as well,
so it became my dream very quick to follow in his footsteps.
So, he was a big person for me growing up.
And there has been a lot of people that have come in and out of my life
and that were there to share their wisdom and help me along the way,
but I would say definitely first and foremost my dad.
Next question, Lily:
Definitely, I'm going to have to do some home cooking here and say Chris Wideman.
He makes me laugh every single day:
just great timing, great sense of humor, and his delivery is really good.
Next question, Liz:
I have a couple from the boys: Pitter, Pitsy, Pits...
but honestly I like Remmer the best, but anything works.
Next, Jenna:
Honestly, it relates to Montreal.
We came here three summers ago.
I think that was the summer that my brother was drafted.
We came after. It wasn't for his development camp;
we actually had a trainer who was connected to someone here in Montreal, John Parrish Jr.,
and he had a hockey team here at the practice arena for the Montreal Canadiens.
So, it was really fun to see the city with my brother, Rhett,
and just kind of explore a place that he was just drafted by.
Little did I know I was going to be playing here as well, so... pretty cool.
Next question, William:
I would say that there's no secret.
I'm trying to get some more shots off, and I just work on my shot every day.
So, I think all areas of my game, I'm always trying to work on.
Next question, Melissa:
I'm excited to explore a lot of things.
I like being outside in nature, so I've been going for a couple of walks.
I'm a big foodie and my cousin here who just came, he's a big foodie as well,
so we went to the sushi place RYU and had a little chef's tasting menu.
So, it's fun to explore food and it was fun to be with him.
So, food, nature, those are kind of my one-twos.
Last question, Rain:
I'm not sure specifically what we're talking about,
but I think I wear two necklaces and one of them is kind of a bigger black coin.
It just says: ""Jesus, I trust in you."" So...
Actually, kind of going back to the role models, another one is my agent.
His name is Neil Sheehy.
I met him when I was young, and...
You know, a lot of people believe in different things, and I believe in Jesus.
I'm not saying that's right or wrong; I just have a connection to a higher power,
and I think a lot of people call it different things.
It's not necessarily about the teachings, I think it's just something to ground me in the core principle
to be the best person I can be --
I know I'm not perfect, I get emotional sometimes, I say the wrong things, I do the wrong things,
but it's just kind of nice to have something around your neck that reminds you to
kind of push yourself to be the best version of yourself, even though you know it won't be perfect.
So, that's what it is."
Connor Hall,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN4UnuQVA4I,"frustrating night at Newport especially
given the performance that we had on
Saturday yeah really frustrating uh Lads
are absolutely gued in there um but we
only got ourselves to blame we didn't
play anywhere near the level that we've
shown in recent weeks um even though we
haven't got results but like Saturday we
got a result and played really well and
we come here on a Tuesday night
expecting another really good
performance and it's just not happened
at all and I suppose that's kind of been
the theme over the course of the season
so far we're only called nine 10 games
in but that consistency we're not going
from game to game and showing it the
same yeah and that's the key word
consistency um if we can be
consistent we'll we'll climb the climb
the league no doubt about it we've got
so much quality in this in this dressing
room um we've shown it a lot of times
this season but there's times where
we've not shown it and we've not turned
up again like tonight or we've had a
good win a weekend or a Tuesday and not
followed it up uh have to start
following up have to start going on runs
if we want to climb up that league and I
suppose there are also teams that when
they don't play well they do grind out a
result and do get the win especially
given that we went ahead as well yeah
that's it we haven't performed well but
you're not always going to perform well
in games um every week but we've gone
one new up and we're away from home we
got something to hold on to uh and we
should be able to see out a one-nil win
uh and we haven't done that tonight and
there's got to be a bit of ruthlessness
and clinical at both ends asn't they
defending making sure you're defending
your goal and when the chances do come
your way especially in tight games like
this which there's going to be you have
to take chances yeah we do yeah and it's
been the story of our season so far and
it was a bit like that Saturday
obviously we were able to take our
chances uh but we still let in four
goals um and then tonight we've had some
really good chances to score more than
more than that one goal um and bare
minimum We Come Away with a draw and not
played well at all um but we've come
away with nothing and we can't keep
doing that yeah and it's a tough week
three games in eight days so it would be
case of a blend of
resting working out where you went wrong
and where you can do better ahead of
Saturday's game yeah but we we got to
pick ourselves up we got to go again we'
got a big game on Saturday um at home in
front of our fans and uh we got to put
on a performance for
them"

Luke Green,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0xr-ecIoC0,"um well first of all gentlemen thank you
guys for coming like i said wednesday 11
o'clock midday i appreciate that for for
you guys both being here
yeah luke you said you were getting a
hold of some emails this morning i was
like hey
a little pro hockey a little business on
the side you're you're becoming a man of
of both skill sets how's that coming for
you yeah that's the plan uh it's
going well so far yeah it's hockey's
well uh the
professional side or the playing side
it's been my life for
since i can remember so to branch out
into different areas and still
stick with the hockey it's yeah it's i'm
having fun with it
what gave you the idea to start a hockey
camp
uh i wanted to do one for the last
couple years i think
growing up as a defenseman
specifically an offensive defenseman i
took quite a bit of heat maybe or
heat that i didn't really expect or
didn't wasn't aware of just
just just comes with the position i
guess
and i wasn't uh i had a lot of help in
the offensive side and the skill work
and skating and
i excelled in that but um just specific
uh
defense skills that weren't really
taught whether it be angling or
one-on-ones or gaps um those things i
i wasn't uh taught a ton of in minor
hockey so when i got to the junior
major junior level and the pro level um
it might have taken a little longer yeah
but if i could
give back and and teach kids in minor
hockey some of those
defense specific skills that's that's my
goal and i
truly believe it'll it'll halt their
development and speed it up
speed up the process along the way
that's awesome i'm happy to hear that
you you found a direction in that sense
and that you think that you can help
other people
i find the communication i've played
hockey majority of my life and
i think it's a it's an interesting skill
set to be able to communicate certain
things to
to younger hockey players and i guess it
depends too on the player if the player
is willing to learn it or not but
i've definitely had coaches in my day
that were terrible at it and i've had
coaches in my day that were amazing at
it that were able to translate a game
just through drawing on a whiteboard on
how to implement something and it's a
skill set so
i wish you all the best and i hope
everything goes well uh with the camp
this year and we're excited to be
involved with it as well yeah super
excited to have you guys and then kiefer
i know you have
do you have your own camp as well yeah i
found my own company it's basically what
i
that's how i make my living i run a
top-shelf hockey program so
um i'm actually not lucky enough luke
invited me out to help him out with his
camp this summer so
it's a fun kind of full circle thing
where i can remember him and his brother
being out at hockey schools when they
were probably
adam or peewee i guess was the first
time i crossed
and then we spent some time at new
bridge together and kind of
stayed loosely connected ever since so
yeah it's fun to
uh i mean i'm getting to that age now
where guys that i
coached or had in hockey schools and
stuff way back when are now
playing pro and doing all kinds of cool
things or in college and stuff so it's
neat to see
some of the some of the roots and
experiences they've had
what are some of the things that you saw
on luke and his brother at such a young
age that you see
now it was uh i'm not and i'm not saying
this i
trust me because he's here but like they
just were wired differently you know
like that's
in what sense uh just the the
athleticism
and the the compete probably more than
anything else and the willingness to
just
try stuff you know like you could throw
anything at them
like i i remember it was uh probably
weakness to strengths was a camp that uh
cam russell and chris donnelly used to
run
over in coal harbor i think that was the
first time i met them
and uh it was just simple stuff like
shoot the duck and stuff like that like
they were just having a ball
out doing it yeah and and i was probably
the opposite when
i was a player i would be like i wasn't
a great skater but
you know you would try stuff but you
kind of like half fake that you were
doing it and these guys were just they
would wipe out and hop back up and try
it again and then nail it and
you know it was just kind of going on
but it was just kind of infectious to
watch
them go at it yeah and then uh when i
got to
i spent a lot of time with them the
couple years ago we were together at new
bridge and that was really when
smaller group size and spending a lot of
time on the ice working on
specific things that uh i think was
pretty cool to see
that whole evolution come and just watch
from the beginning of a school year to
the end of the school year how much
progress they would make
but just had something you know just
that willingness to get better every day
i think is probably the biggest thing
and that's one thing i always admire
about
you know kids at that age that they have
a willingness to learn i know
i'm gonna you know probably most don't
and if you're able to have that skill
set at that young of an age that's
always fascinated me because i didn't
where do you think that that that drive
to compete and to be better came out at
such a young age for you and your
brother
good question parents yes parents have a
a
huge play a huge role in it yeah they
always
yeah we were lucky enough to have great
parents that instilled
hard work and um commitment dedication
all the main
fundamentals into us and i think it did
help having a twin brother though to
to push each other yeah we were so
competitive and i always want to be
better than him and if i i did well he
wanted to
do better and i think that that
made us always hungry and every time
we're on the ice and it's usually
together
we'd uh we compete against each other
and i think that helped both of us
um with your guys's hockey camp coming
up what's what's your game playing
together i'm assuming you guys have
went out to starbucks and grabbed a
coffee together and sat down and talked
about how you're going to implement
a better learning strategy what's the
strategy yeah um
it's honestly going back to fun it's
gonna be a camp that i
would have loved when i was a kid it's
gonna be something i would have jumped
all over
uh defense specific camp for kids who
wanna
take their game to the next level and um
are looking for
for some ice in the summer i think it it
lines up just before uh
the major bantam camps and the the the
tryouts so it's good timing it's yeah
again something i would have been all
over and it's
it's gonna be a lot of fun and you're
gonna learn learn a lot it's gonna be
stuff that i've
i've taken from the pro level and i'm
i'm showing it to you
now in minor hockey which which i would
have uh benefited a lot from
are you going to be looking to learn
anything from him at all since he's been
like in the business for a bit are you
looking to like steal from him a little
oh definitely yeah i yeah some of the
the drills i have are definitely from
kiefer
he's uh he taught me a lot and um he can
he won't say this either but he can he
can demo the drills he's one of
he's one who can he'll show you
something on the whiteboard but he'll be
probably the best at the drill too he'll
be at the front of the line yeah he uh
backs up his what he he teaches"

Sean Day,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BQ6dmXgSGw,"so as you come in this year what's the
feeling for you to be back here and a
little a little bit more
experience uh I mean it's it's obviously
good to be back you you know the first
time you come to Camp you never really
know what to expect so um uh it's a
little bit more challenging but uh this
year for sure I came in and just had
like the mindset that I wanted to be
better than I was last year and even
though I went to you know had a long
season in the me cup I just tried my
hardest for those 3 and 1/2 weeks or
whatever it was to get in shape enough
to to come here and still make an impact
or uh uh you know just show the
improvements I guess and um I think I've
I've done a pretty good job and I just
want to keep getting uh you know more
improved throughout the summer and then
into next year now you're a puck moving
defenseman you take pride in your in
your offense but I'm sure you want to be
a well-rounded defenseman also right
yeah for sure I think this year you know
both sides my uh of the puck my game got
a lot better just taking steps and um
I've always had I think the offensive
instincts but for sure this year I felt
a lot better defensively and um you know
I I want to keep working on that I I've
started to take a lot of pride in that
and just being a well-rounded defenseman
and um uh you know like I said I think
this year I took a lot of uh you know
good steps into becoming that that
defenseman and um you know the type of
player I want to be in the future well
show team wise on the ice your first
year professional hockey win a
championship what was that like yeah I
mean uh the Memorial Cup is you know
it's one of the hardest trophies I think
to win so uh you know to end off my my
junior career like that would be um you
know it was unbelievable I think and uh
you know to be traded to Windsor and
have the chance to host it in the in the
city of Windsor was awesome the fans
were were you know behind us the whole
way so uh unbelievable experience the
whole time and um you know I couldn't
ask for a better way I think to to go
out a junior and and and do you look at
um some of the success have you looked
at the Rangers back end have you watch
them and and say and see yourself and go
okay I see I see where I want to be uh I
mean all young guys coming up they
always you know picture themselves in
the you know the jersey that they're
drafted to for sure uh you know
obviously this year I watched a lot more
of the Rangers just cuz I was drafted
here and um I do watch the defensive uh
you know the the parent that they have
and see if I could fit in anywhere and
and stuff like that but uh it's not the
biggest thing on my mind it's more just
I want to become you know an impact
player in the league and uh whichever
however long that takes to develop that
um you know obviously I'm willing to do
that just to I don't want to be another
guy in the NHL I want to be you know a
big time player and uh you know be an
offensive guy a defensive guy anything
that they want me to
be"

Garrett Pilon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NKYrDx7kLM,"we're here with the new Senators forward
Garrett Pilon joins the club after
winning a Calder Cup with the Hershey
Bears last season
um welcome to Belleville congrats on
that Achievement First of all yeah no
thank you very much I'm glad to be here
that's for sure yeah let's talk a little
bit about the process that you spent
your entire career in the the capitals
organization between Washington and
Hershey obviously culminates with that
Calder Cup last season and now here you
are in a brand new town um what was the
process like to to getting to Belleville
and and why did this seem like a good
fit for you uh you know it's definitely
uh was a team I guess that was was
interested in me which is the first
thing when you go into free agency you
kind of need teams like that want you
kind of thing and
um you know I I think as a group they
were they were looking to build down
here in Belleville as well and that's
something that you know I want to do
again is win so it seemed like a good
option for myself and just my career
going forward but uh yeah I've been
loving it so far guys it's been great
yeah one of the first impressions been
like of the facility uh the town I know
you haven't been here long it's a little
bit different than uh than what you've
been used to in Hershey yeah you know
the facility is great here guys have
been really good I mean the town I'm
from Saskatchewan it's it's very similar
like small town sort of Vibes and you
know you know so I'm enjoying it and
looking to find kind of some spots here
to some restaurants and all that and you
know get a little settled yeah there'll
be plenty of those for you to find for
sure
um I have the first couple days of camp
in what's it been like I guess trying to
adjust to new systems new coaches new
teammates yeah you know it is it's the
first for me obviously entering a new
organization new like philosophies in a
certain aspect so it is a bit of an
adjustment but just looking to kind of
soak things up talk things through you
know really start to learn um you know
the ins and out of the systems before
the season here starts and
um you know the first couple days just
kind of getting some the rust and the
king so from the summer because there's
there's usually quite a bit so it's
getting better though which is good yeah
what else did you get up to in the
summertime how do you like to spend your
free time when you're away from the rink
oh it was a short one this year that's
for sure I got home I think mid July
which is crazy uh but no just I visited
some family obviously and then uh just
moved into my place so it was it was it
was pretty short but obviously uh you
know I like to go out golf do that hang
out with friends go to the lake got a
little bit about him but not too much so
yeah right back into hockey we're
chatting with sounds forward Garrett
Pilon you're a veteran player a 250 plus
games in the American Hockey League
um how would you describe your playing
style and maybe how has it kind of
developed over over your career if at
all yeah it's weird getting up there for
games and all that you know it doesn't
doesn't seem like uh seems like
yesterday I guess that I was 20 year old
entering the league so it is an
adjustment you start to learn a few
things and
um you know adjusting the play Styles
I'm just trying to be a full 200 foot
player and uh you know those are the I
think the types of guys too that can
help um you know Win Hockey games
because there's there's guys that have
obviously obviously High skill and I can
put the puck on the net but you do need
the guys that couldn't play both ends of
the rank and you know help contribute
but they can so I'm hoping to just kind
of be that versatile player for for the
sentence here and you know I'll do
whatever is asking me and bring
obviously some veteran leadership to uh
what's a pretty
um talented I'd say pool of prospects
still in the organization as well yeah
you know looking at the roster and stuff
I mean we are there there is quite a bit
of Youth in this organization which is
really good because there's a lot of
high skill
um you know good hockey players good
people as well so I think that's
something that was exciting for me
coming into this organization because
once you win once you really want to do
it again so that's obviously the The
Hope coming into this season and
speaking of winning that Championship
you'll get to be back in Hershey for the
banner raising on uh their opening night
with with the sends how much are you
looking forward to to going back there
yeah you know I spent obviously five
years there and grew up a lot there and
you know fell in love with the town and
all that so I've nothing but fond
memories of Hershey and it's going to be
definitely we're lining up on the other
blue line for me I mean obviously
there's a lot of players that have been
through that in their careers but it'll
definitely be a first for me kind of
playing against guys that I was battling
it out with uh and at the end of June
there so it would definitely be weird
but we're gonna have to set the tone
somehow at the start there so yeah I'm
looking forward to it being back there
well we're happy to have you here uh
thanks again for the time and welcome to
Bell yeah awesome thank you very much"

knuckle fighter that bit someone's ear
off about three months ago obviously
Queensbury rules but it should be an
entertaining fight I mentioned the
charity so last year I I was introduced
to a young girl called Isla uh Isla
Wynne young girl she was brought to my
Pub by her parents my little girl played
with her all day you know I fell in love
with a little girl knowing what her
situation was she was diagnosed with
dipg cancer and you know it was only a
matter of time before they lost her and
I vowed I would raise some money for uh
dipg cancer research now this charity is
called uh Abby's Army
um so the mum and dad wanted me to jump
out of a plane to raise money and I'm a
coward like that so I said I know what
I'd do I have a charity boxing match and
obviously now I've picked Mercury or
bash I'm starting to think I might have
uh should have jumped out of a plane
trying to get this Misfits card as well
I mean if you want to fight me up I'll
I'll fight you about a little bit to uh
Victor experience for me but look if I
come through this and have another one
let's let's have a dance"
Jack Kopacka,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCufXKc9Mg8,"it's just getting back to the
fundamentals and uh just moving my feet
and just just continue to work in hard
you know a few guys called up to Anaheim
this lineup has changed how much of an
opportunity does it present a guy like
you yeah it was great I got a little bit
more opportunity I think I think we
played really well tonight just based on
the fact that we were rolling all four
and we got some consistency going by
rolling those lines and guys guys
refresh we know San Jose had that third
period last night they come back what
was the talk on the bench when Stockton
did the same thing to take the leap you
know I don't think that there was
definitely no panic on the bench we just
we just stuck with it we know we don't
have another game to play we know he got
a few days off so it's just empty the
tank and that's all we focused on
finally with the game on your stick in
the shootout what were you thinking is
your approach Gilley's I can already had
a plan in my head just I knew I was
gonna shoot it just didn't know where
until I got down there how much of a
confidence boost is it for this team to
get that win before the break it was
great you know you go into the break
with kind of a fresh start and you know
the emotions are high so it's great"

Jacob Cederholm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0aWovR1VxA,"[Music]
well Jacob we have to start with
congratulations on a championship back
home in Sweden must be exciting to see
your time as a junior come to a close
with success with some good friends yeah
thank you very much first of all and
yeah I was it was well it's hard to
describe how the feeling was after that
because we've been going like four years
with those guys and to end the juniors
for them it was a rule it was a fairy
tale to make it extra exciting happen in
overtime can you take us through the
moment when you realized you were
champions oh to be honest I didn't even
see the goal I was sitting I was going
back after I shift and sitting back and
just I couldn't I couldn't watch the
game because I was so nervous and then
the guys were just jumping in and that's
from that I've got a blackout so it's
amazing how things work and in the world
of pro sports because you have that high
moment that great time and then all of a
sudden you're preparing to go to a
different continent yeah it's it's we're
moving fast here but that's that's how
it is here and I like it I'm really
excited to be here so it's all fun
it's all fun for me it's almost about
the season as a whole because I know you
played junior you played in the second
division with a couple of teams and you
also got to play in the Swedish Hockey
League so what was it like for you to
play with the different teams at the
different levels yeah I mean you get
more experience of course and and you
see how how it's working in every League
and the professionality and and how the
guys are how the guys are doing their
rituals and so on so I mean you learn a
lot it's a lot of to take in it's a lot
it's a lot of things going on in your
head and mentally and so on so as long
as you're mentally prepared for it I
think that you can learn something from
it and when you come to that stage next
time you're ready for it what do you
think about this season in terms of your
overall game what do you see improve I
think I improved most of my game
being more confident in in pressure
situations and enjoying enjoying playing
in the high high leagues and enjoying
like always wanted to get the puck and
and being involved with the play I think
grow up in Sweden obviously it's a goal
to play in the Swedish Hockey League so
what's it like to play at the very
highest level back home and and be with
the best players there well it's it's a
fast game and and the bigger rinks to
that it is here so it's a fast game with
a lot of skating and the guys are very
skilled so I mean it's a you can learn a
lot from it so when I'm playing I was
playing there was just taken all in and
in trying to develop it into my game is
the Swedish Hockey League good
preparation for the American Hockey
League I think so yes both both yes and
no I mean obviously it's it's a bigger
ring so maybe I would have should have
gone to a smaller ring to prepare even
better but I think the high pace and and
the skill level at that in that league
is is very high just your thoughts on
coming here again you've got some
familiarity with the facilities and the
organisation having been here a couple
of times before is it feel like a
familiar place to come in here and try
and get started with the team at the end
of the year yes it's us I mean I have
been the guys have been already taking
good care of me in here and and welcomed
me very well so I know some of the guys
before and and obviously the staff and
the equipment staff and so on so I think
that I'm feeling yeah I I feel like I've
you know I've been here before so it's
it's a I feel comfortable here welcome
and thanks very much for this thank you
very much"

Brett Murray,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZZ-wXS1bwY,"about
[Music]
uh
[Music]
very happy with the year
yeah guys sorry yeah I'd say so
um I mean anytime you go to career highs
it's a pretty nice feeling
and uh to help uh to help the team and
organization you know put a banner in
the rafters is
uh
the great combination
yeah absolutely I think we all
sort of brought a little something
different
play style wise
[Applause]
that kind of meshed
very well
um
I think
mercy and I are pretty similar players
uh when it comes to you know the way we
think the game and the way we play and
how we are going to produce
have success and you know Yachts is
very fast and skilled and thinks the
game really well so to have guys that uh
you know you can sort of read off of and
you know what they're going to do and
they know what you're gonna do
um you know what they're how they're
going to play where they're gonna be
um yeah it just meshed really well and
you know it's fortunate to have
two uh two really good hockey players
beside me here
a little bit of a downside for you the
cheers
so no injuries no recalls and
opportunities didn't present itself
unfortunately if there had been you
would have been there
it's a disappointed
absolutely
um I mean everyone's goal is to play at
the highest level that you you can play
out you think you can play it and
uh it's just kind of the way it goes
sometimes
you never you never wish you know
injuries or bad things on other players
but in this business
sometimes that's what it takes and you
know they're healthy up there and
I'll just use it as fuel to have a have
a good off season and come back and you
know not have to rely on someone going
down um
yeah maybe I can just put my foot right
in the door and start from our training
camp so
starting to know a little bit about the
team
being so young at the start of the year
it didn't surprise you and then the way
the team improve over here
uh I wouldn't say surprised
um you're definitely pleased
I mean they're young for sure but look
at the skill they got right I mean
um it was just a matter of time until we
you know did what we did honestly
um
especially with the leadership group
you're able to have young guys like that
with with so much skill come in because
you can rely on guys like Michael merch
brow and Malone to you know teach them
and guide them and and uh show them how
to you know Win Hockey games and Win
Hockey games all the way into June so
yeah
but uh
including yourself guys like like
versions you know the problem in the
opposite and pilot and and agencies
[Music]
I mean
I think uh
yeah I think they played well I think uh
I think I mean the opposite was
unbelievable in the playoffs I mean not
only the playoffs but especially the
playoffs I mean
I was fortunate enough to to benefit
from him being so successful and our son
is lying but uh yeah immersion and and
those guys and pilot and I think
everyone just had an unbelievable season
and it came together for us really well
everybody's talking about the bonding of
this team how special this team this is
uh yeah absolutely
um I mean
you've probably got similar answers all
from everyone so far but uh
you know you don't really get
a locker room that that bonds so much
and that comes together and in place
you know so hard for for the guy next to
him and and uh it was it was a really
special thing to be a part of for sure
yeah but anyway you got it great job on
your part this year outstanding it's so
much fun to watch you plug in yeah
[Music]
we'll see
if you really need a little a few days
Russia yeah uh we'll take some time to
you know recoup from the season and you
know let the body reset and then
get right back into it for next season
great job on your partner
Good original
a warrant did you say I could go
yeah all yours sorry hey Brad um I guess
my biggest question is everybody who's
walked in today has remarked something
about how special this team is how
tight-knit this group of guys is what
about it in that room has really made
this what feels like a closer than most
teams obviously you've been a while
you're a veteran at this but what made
this Brotherhood so special this year
was it the ability to get things going
on ice or just spending time together
good question
I think
you know when it comes to Pro Hockey
they're
it is a business uh right and and
you know I think one thing that really
set this team is apart from from you
know other teams is uh
we didn't look at it
as you know that's that's a teammate he
signed his contract and and we're
playing for the same team as like
you know we became friends and I was
just playing hockey with with my you
know 23 closest buddies
um not 23 teammates that are also just
pro hockey players um
I think that that gave us success on the
ice which in turn just
made it you know that Bond even even
stronger because you know when you're
winning everyone's everyone's having fun
and
um it was a bit of a Snowball Effect it
just kept going so
awesome thanks Brad for another great
year"

well for the family is awesome because
we both have to get to or get to play
with Cyclones and get to practice
together and play and obviously means a
lot to me too because I've been AP in
for two years and I finally got a spot
this year it's going to be a lot of fun
competing in practice and just pushing
each other to get better and obviously
playing with them on the ice I'm a
defensive defenseman and I really just
like to stick up for my teammates and
kind of just do that I would like to
thank my parents teachers coaches
trainers and my grandpa"
Mikhail Maltsev,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQw_EFFM3HU,"thank you
Okay so we're on six games
uh you've had quite a little bit of a
scoring streak going uh since you're you
come back inside the the surgery
how's everything feeling for uh with the
leg and skating and everything like that
everything is good I feel good
first couple of games was uh too fast
for me actually
uh it was like I came up to her summer
like a whole season like everybody's uh
already one month left and everybody's
skating running so I was a little bit
shocked but yeah it was good it's like
to jump in the cold water that's what I
need but now it's getting better and
better every game so
and then
um you were skating a little bit on your
your own from what I was being told by
the coach and and by PR and everything
uh how long were you skating on your own
before you you hit the ice with the team
I started at the beginning of uh
February February yeah
then probably almost one month
it was hidden on my own in a couple
practices for the long contact Jersey
and then yeah
so the the way I was described the the
situation by
Crow was that
I
it was a skate blade that sliced your
thigh or something like that it's kind
of like just to put it in general terms
yeah yeah so let's just cut above the
knee so and of course required to a bit
deeper yeah than we expected
um what was your initial reaction when
that happened because I mean if it were
me because since I play yeah it was like
a usual Collision we were in the power
place so uh I was surprised what
happened
because I didn't fail uh he didn't jump
on me on something else
I felt something like with my knee
so I couldn't step on it so I
I didn't know what's wrong but then I
saw the cut but I didn't expect that it
was something
so but they told me we are all the
surgery
in two days and we'll see so how it goes
so the best scenario was one month but
it was deeper so
uh was like 60 of Tandem because yeah so
they said like it's gonna be a long uh
maybe more than four months but I did a
good recovery yeah like instructions
exercises
uh
just three and a half months okay well
and then um and then of course you were
you were up and down with the Avalanche
last season and I know this this injury
situation kind of hurt
your your ability to go up and down this
year but did they give you anything to
work on this year
I mean I was like only five games
not a long time I played like five games
here and uh
12 here so probably almost one month
so it was mentally hard because I know
it's uh
Drive
I have not many chances but uh uh we'll
see how it goes nothing now they didn't
tell me nothing so uh the best uh the
best is to me is just to play and find
my game that I played in the first first
months
I think I was pretty good so I was still
trying to find
and what do you feel you're your best
strength is yourself I think my body is
using my size uh
battles
with the face-offs
that's it
and then this is something I ask
everyone what's your favorite type of
music
uh listen to Russian music Russian I
think it's
raped oh okay any particular artist that
you like
I don't know I like Kendrick Lamar
's uh yeah I mostly on Russian music
awesome sweet thank you so much thank
you yeah"
Todd Burgess,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxlVeU6pzkQ,"hey everybody austin sir agusa from
moose tv here joined by the
newest signing of the manitoba moose
forward todd burgess todd good to
finally catch up with you uh
first off just take us through that uh
process of signing your first
professional contract um
i'm sure it's a super exciting moment
for you and your family it was awesome
it was just
something i've been looking forward to
my entire career making that next step
excited for this next chapter and i'm
glad i got to
spend my last year at minnesota state
and and i'm excited to get up to
manitoba
so let's just talk about that that final
and only season you had with minnesota
state you know 14 points in 25 games
and you also advanced the frozen four
this season that's of course the first
time that that school has advanced to
the frozen four just what was that
experience like for you and that team to
make some school history obviously
didn't
end the way you guys would have liked
but i'm just playing some of the most
competitive college hockey
in the united states what was that like
yeah it was awesome it was uh
definitely a different year with covet
and not being able to have fans in the
building so i think it
um kind of our team grew closer together
and i think
we were clicking right off the start it
was it was something i haven't been a
part of
in a long time and it was kind of a
special thing to go through this year
we we're so close to the end there and
uh we thought we could we could see
it all the way through but uh all
together it was just a great experience
so that one season that minnesota state
on top of the three seasons you played
at rpi
um just what does all that college
hockey experience do for you
in making that jump to the pro level
um i think i think it does a lot you see
it in different
two different programs going from rpi to
here i think you
you learn a lot you get to under
underneath two different types of
coaches
two different playing styles and i think
that's something
i can bring into uh the professional
level
so of course alternate captain cjc spent
four years with the mavericks winnipeg
jets draft pick nathan smith also
played their last season so there are a
lot of connections uh down there already
so
um i know you talked to me before saying
you don't know cj but you know what kind
of player he was
when he played there just so how excited
are you to finally come up and meet a
guy like that who's uh
spent so much time there with the
organization as well yeah i'm really
excited i've uh
i've seen his picture on the wall here
in minnesota state and i've heard
some good stories that he's a good guy
so uh looking forward to
meeting him and getting up to manitoba
like i said you of course were also born
in
arizona so typically not what we think
of as a hockey market up here in
winnipeg but just what was that
experience like
uh in your younger years playing in a
market like that
i was it was definitely different um
rather than playing up in
in canada or minnesota where i am now um
hockey
was there wasn't really any hockey
growing up there but it's it's slowly
getting better you got
austin matthews kind of leading the way
and the coyotes are getting better each
each and every year and i think i think
this
the sport is growing rapidly in arizona
i think it's great to see and
hopefully i can continue that process so
with training camp
now just a few months away here in
winnipeg what are your big goals for the
summer you know like like we said it was
a big season for you
uh in the college hockey ranks this year
but um now that summer's sort of in full
swing what's the plan before you head up
to winnipeg for camp
i think just uh get my cardio up uh keep
keep getting on the ice as much as i can
i think i
uh i'm doing a great job of that now
training up here with
with the team in minnesota and uh just
just keep doing that throughout the
summer
and for fans who might not have had a
chance to watch you in the frozen four
or
during your college hockey or it's just
what kind of player are you what do you
bring to the table when you do
get to memphis moose camp um
i think i'm uh more of a two-way forward
i think i uh
my size comes into effect so i think i'm
gonna just keep doing that keep uh
fueling the body so i'll be ready for uh
for when the season
starts and the puck drops well todd
thanks again for the time
congratulations on signing the contract
and we'll see you up at camp soon
thanks a lot"
Max Zimmer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q2bv-n33dA,"and so I came to her friend's house uh
we didn't she was like don't expect to
have
okay um okay thought we were just G to
play Uno yeah I
thought invited me over for this
particular reason that's fine um so we
weren't going to have SE then her friend
went down to do art and her friend was
leaving and she was like yeah you guys
can or whatever and we were in her bed
anyways long story short I her without a
condom then I in her friend's bed and I
freaked out and I didn't know what to do
and so I dumped Red Bull actually onto
it and I like no no we're just going to
pretend like I spilled my drink and I
left and she then gave me a pregnancy
scare I told I think I told you about
this pregnancy scare pregnancy scare for
six weeks she gave me well you do know
like Red Bull and like Seaman like it it
like that Vapor it vaporizes it so like
if you inhale it it's like there's a
good chance you can get pregnant from
that oh yeah I heard about that yeah
yeah that's what was that what was that
what was that attitude I is that are you
I'm being dead ass you're being dead ass
do you know about that no I it was like
a vice video it was like a two-part
series I don't think she was like
[ __ ] with you I just is that actually
a vice yeah oh no no no that was my idea
I poured the Red Bull on it cuz she yeah
well that was probably like the last
thing you should have poured on the C
but twers love Red Bull I guess that's
czy yeah I'm [ __ ] with
you it was slow oh
was look at my twins that's Mary Kate
that's Mary Kate that's Mary Kate look
at these twins that's Mary Kate that's
Mary Kate that's Mary Kate look at these
twins that's Mary Kate that's Mary Kate
that's Mary Kate look at these twinsy ky
ky titties out titties out
like I had my mom pick me
up wait did your friend did you tell
your mom yeah like well no cuz she she
gave me a pregnancy scare after that for
about 6 weeks and it was just like
really freaky and then she left school
and she just moved away damn you sent
her away dude no I didn't
actually I saw her at the I saw her at
the gym recently I go to the gym down
Malibu and I saw her there and it was
really [ __ ] weird MH damn saw you
missed her that seems so Ed just like a
homing Beacon right back to her that
little Red Bull you think about her CRA
girl yeah you want some of this dude no
I'm fine I mean you know wait okay wait
but how did she bring up yeah I do
crocodile it was just kind of it was
just kind of like a it was just kind of
like a thing that everyone I don't know
it was just like a thing that this girl
was doing crocodile a lot and where what
this was here in La this was in Malibu
yeah cuz you went to you grew up in
Malibu right I grew up with my mom okay
so wait so what was cuz it's kind of
like a lot of like Hollywood kids there
is it like a it's not I feel like I met
like at Emerson I remember I knew like
three or four kids that Liv in Malibu
and they had like parents who were in
the industry Malibu had a lot of like
these rich kids who were just really
really whitewashed and almost
like it was just it was just this breed
of like really insanely entitled
people um I would say probably a lot of
their parents did like big business and
like highend work but I don't really
know it wasn't oh okay it's it's more
it's more of just like they were rich
and they grew up rich and they all drove
Teslas at 15 and wow did you grow up
rich I mean sure I my yeah but that's
not like yeah what you say no no it's
for for me um I it's like a it's like
yeah I I I I have affluent parents or my
dad is um but I try and separate myself
from that so my brother and I like my
brother's on a huge end of that spectrum
of trying to I mean he moved to Portland
he doesn't take a dime from my dad he
doesn't want any affiliation with my
dad's name uh yeah I mean is it like a
is it tension with your dad or is it
just like like a pride thing of like
wanting to be his own person it's
Integrity okay for me it's like the same
thing like I like for me buying cameras
and investing my money into cameras and
then knowing how to actually use them
and like for me I went away for just
[ __ ] depression and [ __ ] like my like
when your parents have money send you
away and [ __ ] it's just like the easiest
thing they can do so I went away for
that but I in that I understood a lot of
psychology and stuff I didn't know I
wanted to do cinematography or
photography
uh then I kind of got into it and just
kind of fell into a thing of
like I know how I want to tell emotions
through a camera
and if I can buy the tools then you know
yeah acquire that for myself and and so
for me it's like yeah I've sunk in my
own money that I've worked for and you
know I like I still live with my dad but
I just I lived right over in Koga Park
actually that was [ __ ] so I moved back
and it's just like you know fine that's
the little bit of I don't think there's
anything wrong with right I have
integrity in that I don't there's
there's nothing wrong with it it's
that's my life and that's what I grow up
knowing you know that's cool wait so
okay for context also for viewers Han
Zimmer that's Max's dad just want to
want to make I didn't know that oh no
it's fine I that's I'd never bring it up
I wouldn't have brought it up either and
it's but it's fine it's you know it's
it's that's my life it's yeah my dad is
a big name in music and do you hate it
though like or how like where do you
stand with it that's a crazy question
because it's not that easy mhm I'll give
you a few examples um we'll start start
with what I hate mhm and hate is a
strong word because it's like it's like
dislike what do you dislike about it
well yeah it's just like the
uncomfortability of it for instance um I
worked I did a lot of backline for his
tour I did about three years of touring
with my dad that I worked for that was
great and then the last year when he
went to Dubai it was this kind of
wishy-washy situation I didn't really
like and that's a crazy sentence when my
dad went to do oh that you know I I
understand there's a lot of gravity in
that but I have to get over it I felt
really [ __ ] weird about being there
and it just felt wrong and it just I
didn't like it like like what what do
you mean by like like almost like
nepotism kind of thing like you been
there well sure I mean the nepotism will
always be a thing for those jobs like I
got nepotism was working backline and
patching cables making looms and you
know just gaffing [ __ ] and and and
cleaning up a stage yeah
um it was this was more like I want I I
had finally developed some sort of
cinematography profile for myself and I
wanted to do some sort of camera you
know AC work some sort of film work and
it just felt
like give him a bone throw this guy a
bone I just you know I was fine really
doing anything like I didn't bring a
setup or anything like that I didn't
bring any cool camera with I didn't have
an expectation I just wanted to say hey
can I volunteer into this position
you're getting a real camera crew it was
this director who's a fantastic director
I've seen a bunch of his other work it's
this guy Paul dugdale who does a bunch
of music videos he really he brings the
crew he brings the great Alexa LF
cameras with the lenses and it's like
they're they're really set up in in what
they do and they have the giant Panther
cranes and the uh you know huge jibs
that come down and it's great it looks
great and they do a good job and I was
hoping just to get some better
introduction yeah to that world and it
would it just felt weird and so I left
early I said hey I'm going to take my
Integrity with me I kind of just don't
feel like these I feel like I'm stepping
on a lot of toes I don't want that
feeling I just yeah so I left early and
on the
flight I got a text from the lighting
department uh because I'm I'm really
good friends with everyone on that tour
I got a text from the head of the
lightning Department he said max did you
hear about what your father just did and
it I was like no I'm on a plane it's 15
hours I I I don't I haven't even taken
off yet um and apparently on stage um at
the night before my dad had proposed to
his girlfriend who wasn't even divorced
or like he had proposed to her in front
of 17,000 people and it was like didn't
tell us I I'm I'm a child of four three
and and a half
um didn't tell any of his family didn't
tell anyone surprised her on stage she
said yes and it was like this whole huge
it was it was just a crazy Affair it it
ABS it sent it sent me into a spiral of
just like what the [ __ ] yeah and it's
not the first thing first time that
that's happened and it was like wait
wait was this moment scored by like his
songs or was it just no it was on stage
it was like he was doing was playing in
the background and he's like he was in
he was like at the end of an
intermission and it was just
like and that was really shocking and
crazy cuz it was first off this is such
a personal private matter second off
it's being displayed in front of 17 and
then Millions because I read it before I
I looked it up and TMZ had already
gotten it and it's just like I found out
and this T part part of this ties in
with treatment because years before when
I turned 18 in treatment I found out
through a TMZ article that my parents
parents gone divorced and like that was
that was how I so you know in terms of
the shitty sides the the sides that kind
of you go oh [ __ ] yeah yeah that's you
find out like through another source and
like cuz I remember that's what happened
with Kobe too what do you mean what Kobe
like there his family found out that he
died through TMZ like they didn't know
yeah that's
hor I I don't know how I would have like
that's a horror I mean something to come
call like at that point to even like try
to confirm that you know what I mean
like that's like horrible just call your
dad and the phone's off like okay yeah
yeah he's yeah yeah no that's I mean
it's it's a it's a
weird no I I I'm thinking cuz that's
such a weird invasion of your own
privacy and just to find it out in that
way it's just so like there's no closure
in that it's I feel that's awful like
for me I've never had something so but
it's just like to have your life on
display yeah
and my dad isn't that big but he's big
enough right he's big enough that he's I
mean he's the biggest name in his Niche
category um but I I I mean it's just
it's it's just odd it feels like there's
no private time with that and at the
same time I you know I I think
um you know he's he's only one man yeah
like he I I I I don't think my dad even
wanted to be a film composer yeah uh I
actually no he didn't he want you know
um but it's not as if
like for him to for for him to try and
understand how to do a family and then
how to do a film career it's you know I
I look at that and I go okay with my own
career how would I you know support a
family and support myself and envision
in The Best of Both Worlds I can pick
and choose from him and use him as an
example and go from that and be like
well I'm
I'm he's doing the best honestly with
what he has and I do believe that CU
what are the work weeks like like
literally it's like he's always on the
clock basically right yeah I mean the
man still works 48 hour day sometimes he
can't right now but there's just
like
um you
know he really tries to I mean he he
tries puts in the work he knows what
he's good at it's probably autism but
you is no he's not
but I feel everyone has a touch atis
yeah everybody on the Spectrum at some
somewhere like everyone at like the top
like Tarantino for sure has something
yeah we even the way terano is
incredibly
autistic that man I mean oh my God
that's crazy it's a crazy statement I
feel like I have no room to stand on you
know no ground to stand on because he is
at the best of his game but if there's
anyone to be autistic in in film it's
him and Fincher I feel like I haven't
seen anything seen yeah I I haven't I've
seen like his films but I haven't seen
him as like a person ex yeah I haven't
seen any interviews or anything wa so do
you have like a good relationship with
your I would say so I mean my dad and I
he's probably like also the funniest
person right now he's it's just like um
I tell I I probably told all this the
story but it's one of the best examples
I have of him of just of I I I had I had
these leather pants and they're cool
they're like I think they're kind of
cool they're like Jean straight leg
jeans but they kind of look leather and
whatever I walked downstairs and he went
and he went oh I didn't know I had a gay
son and and and I went yeah and he went
where are you where you going now and I
went well Dad G to go suck some
dick he laugh it was just like I admire
I admire um sense of humor he is a he is
a funny guy I do appreciate what time I
get to spend with him yeah the little
moments exactly now like now my dad um
he's you know he's kind of settled down
a little bit and for me it's nicer just
to spend time with him and I do get a
see him it's he scares the [ __ ] out of
me though he scares the [ __ ] out like
I'll see him in his worst sort of
morning State no coffee his teeth are
unbrushed his hair is uncombed he's got
his bath throb on and it's like
everything is going every which way and
then and then Monday comes and he's
snapped together and he's just like his
hair is sck back he smells good people
are like running around the halls
because it's his it's his studio and
it's just like everyone is trying not to
get caught by him and his shirt's tucked
in and you'll hear his door open and it
it'll it'll crack in a certain way and
people's heads will turn and it's just
like he's very scary damn um and that's
part of the reason I don't want to work
for him cuz I remember I had this with
my parents were like my dad I wouldn't
see him as much just cuz he worked so
much so I I was obviously closer with my
mom and like the little time I was with
my dad it would like make or break what
my opinion is on him did it was it ever
like you didn't view your dad like
you're Terri like you view your dad as
greatly until later in life and you like
saw understood him as a human you know
or did you always get him growing up or
is he um that question made sense yeah
it
did
kinda I mean I've definitely understood
my dad way more now I definitely
I it's been so hard to try and get to
know him as a person like like you he
was just away he was just gone I would I
remember a lot of situations of just
waking up
and uh 700 a.m. and he would take a car
from my mom's house all the way in
Malibu to get to town by 8:00 a.m. and
then he would come back 2 Days Later
later just from being in town just Santa
Monica just sleeping at the studio come
back a few days later you know 6: a.m
tired as hell sleep leave at 5:00 pm
damn damn so [ __ ] rockar dude yeah
but it that's that Drake Bar's like I
got to stop sleeping at the studio you
know yeah he had to stop sleeping at the
studio at like
55 how old is how old is he my dad just
had his birthday let's see if I can uh
figure it out correctly uh 66 damn I
think you just turned yeah how old are
you 21 21 okay okay you're bit like
younger that's I would have thought you
were a little bit older but I mean my I
have a half sister she's 35 five because
I'm guessing I I was going to say four
35 are you the youngest one I I am the
youngest I have a twin and then I and
then I have a Brother's 26 so is okay is
the brothers 26 the one that moved to
Portland Brothers 26 yeah Jake's a
rocket scientist okay so damn yeah so so
so that's such a crazy career to say
like I'm not a rocket scientist but but
he really is no he really is yeah that's
sick I love my brother shout out to my
brother um Jake is Jake is someone who's
very cool he's just someone who builds a
lot and that's something that I got uh I
I I took a lot of that passion that he
had for just building things and putting
it together and that probably is autism
as well but you know um it's just like
making Contraptions and like that he
builds telescopes to be exact okay so he
I don't exactly know what that entails
but he builds some sort of uh mechanism
or design to then be mass-produced by
giant companies
um so in that it's just like building
camera Contraptions and things like that
with my brother he built this really
amazing
85mm uh plate photography camera which
he got he has like a huge projector lens
and a DSLR he built a camera St yeah
it's just a projector lens with a giant
frame it is it's really cool I admire
that sort of stuff um that's crazy and
then what does your twin do Annabelle
does photography okay but I she's good
at it m um what was that what was that I
have to remember I'm also on
camera videotaped is she not as
passionate is no anabal I would say
anabal is actually probably a better
photographer than I am Annabelle's just
not someone who she's not yeah she's not
as serious about it I
um and that sounds that sounds a doubt
like if I showed you her photos they're
very good the composition the lighting
it all looks nice especially when she
shoots it on film or she you know takes
it through like a Dehan process yeah it
looks good she knows what she's doing
obviously but it's just
it it doesn't it it's it's sort of for
me I'm looking at the same type of photo
I don't know how to put it I'm trying to
put it the nicest I can and not be uh
because it's also just like brotherly
[ __ ] that you know I want to throw in
there and just be like a complete
[ __ ] about it um but I love my sister
I think she's a very talented girl I
just wish she would take it further and
actually start putting it to like real
projects and something like that they're
all out of passion I guess okay yeah
yeah wait so how long when did you start
dping what age
um I'd say 18 18 oh wait so so I mean
that would be that would
be I did my first film right at the end
of 17 turning 18 oh sick and that pretty
much went nowhere we scrapped the whole
thing but it was like the project was so
cool yeah I just like the one we worked
on you you live yeah wait should we
believe that what
oh I don't it's General enough it's
General okay well my drug de China my
drug dealer who I used to go to Korea
Town whose address I I I uh I to I still
remember I could tell you it right off
the top of my head okay wait say it but
change one number I'm not going to say
it
okay he knows where I live
too yeah I bet
um I would I mean I asked him to be in
my film and it was crazy he was probably
the best actor too whoa you're Tru deer
when you're film dude yeah he played the
drug dealer and it was just like we used
his apartment which was this horrible
the trap house it was it was this it was
this horrible apartment you would you
would knock on the door and there was
like seven Chihuahuas that he was taking
care of they weren't his but he would
just have these Chihuahuas there and and
and they would start yapping and barking
and biting at the door he'd open the
door up and and your feet would stick to
the floor cuz it was covered in Piss
just covered in Chihuahua piss and and
it was pea pads everywhere there were
two mattresses one stacked on top of the
other and the first mattress was just
black mold it was nothing but black mold
it was just it was just it was soaking
up into the other mattress so basically
contaminating the whole thing uh I don't
know if it was real black but the mold
was black it was a dark dark blue yeah
if anything um was he just living in
there by himself yeah it was just him
him and his chihuaha and his bong and
how did it
smell well it smelled like it smelled
like 10,000 F Breeze bottles and air
canisters smelled great
yeah it's like a it's like a it's like a
12-year-old storm room you know or like
like locker room that's crazy yeah it so
it was awful but we filmed it in there
and
um it was really cool that was a cool
scene but it was it looked horrible
coming out of this giant uh I didn't
know anything about cameras so I thought
video was shot on like I bought a
broadcast camera for like 500 bucks
there's like a telecast like you're
reading offline no no no it was snooze
burned into the bottom it looked like a
it was just like some
Sony
PX whatever I don't even know it was
just some shitty Sony broadcast camera
1080p total of like eight stops of
dynamic range or some crap like that it
you know it was fine and um but it was
it was a great experience and it was
like I realized that I was kind of I
don't
know I thought that I I I thought that I
wanted to do something with that I
didn't I didn't know the whole
department thing um so I just got more
into cameras and I realized that you
know I still have that Sunny camera but
I it's never going to see the light of
day ever but it's just cool to for me it
was cool to do something with that and
then I kept doing things um I can
actually mention her name uh and
hopefully not break Hippa cuz this was
all during treatment while I was in
these facilities uh but my friend Emma
and I would just go around and make
movies and [ __ ] with the Sony camera and
we did one with her friend Abby who
played a stripper and it was really
embarrassing at 18 trying to get this
girl who she would get naked for camera
but she
wouldn't her line delivery was
awful just like a real
stripper so we kept having to do this
line we set it up in this uh hotel with
the other actor it was like this really
shitty hotel that was the idea and the
whole time the hotel staff is like
banging and every tag you can hear it
that they're banging on the door and
[ __ ] and they're ruining every take we
break a light in there and it's just
like this awful awful time and then and
then we open the door with all our gear
packed and we just rush out and we and
we gave the guy like 150 bucks
beforehand yeah we just felt bad but you
know it was just like for for me it was
just like getting into [ __ ] like that
yeah and then working with my dad's tour
it was just doing video for that after
doing audio I did audio for BB but it
all gets very close at the end of it
you're buying the guy's beers every
night and you're going out you're
staying in the same Hotel going to the
same little strip clubs and bars with
them and you know I got close with them
oh it's like us in Amsterdam yeah dud it
was like the four of us it was like me
Maxon Kade Packer Serge Isaiah but we
were the only ones that drank so every
night we just be
outs just watching Sex Shows just two
dudes having boners watching
like we were at there's this one place
called kasar Roso and then it's like I
can't believe you remember the name yeah
I remember the name cuz I saw my bank
statement I'm like yep that's the one
and like it would be like a girl coming
out like in a bikini and she picked
three volunteers and then they'd be
dancing together and then she'd put a
banana in her vagina oh my God and then
she'd make them all take a bite out that
that honest that that experience I feel
like if I if I did that I would have
thrown up yeah I feel like it was
wild that's crazy the guy the first
person to take a bite was the luckiest
and then it was kind of like a human
centipede experiment where it was just
like try to avoid person the last person
or the middle person is really actually
kind of the second it's really the last
person who gets [ __ ] so if I was first
I just take a biggest
bite and then try to nibble out a piece
so was it peeled already and she and she
put it in that's got to [ __ ] her up
though don't you think but then like her
pH balance and [ __ ] I don't know
stranger things have probably happened
to that woman that's wild yeah that's
true cuz what else do we say like we
would see like people having sex on beat
yeah and then one of them ran down the
stage like it was Spider-Man on Broadway
it was like she ran down into the aisles
and she she had for like audience
participation it was great and we kept
trying to like inch our way to the front
I do regret not going to the 5D porn 5D
porn oh yeah there was 5D porn skip
right over three and 4D going right into
the Fifth Dimension so what's the Fifth
Dimension it's they shake the seats and
they like throw she she said nonstaining
liquid yeah soever I would say what if
that still just 4D what's I don't know I
was like no it's like splashy with one I
get I don't know I don't I we've never
experienced such technology in our lives
we I feel like i' well they had the
Shrek 4D thing over there Universal and
that was already nuts love Shrek 4 they
throw water at you it's 4D I love shrike
4D it was like I don't know if it was
nut like like artificial nut like I what
they threw but they said they they'll
Splash you with something in the end I
did it feel like not water oh no we
didn't go in I would I'm just saying I
hope for I mean at least Al maybe we'll
just you and I will just go on a trip we
should we should do boys trip two dudes
getting boners at the club yeah waiting
till our boner goes down you couldn't
have said that in a worse way but did
you did take a peep what people what
love you guys' boners yeah I currently
don't have one no but obviously when he
was bricked up were you like
you want to try to get a boner right
now I'll pass I usually don't get the at
so early in the night it's so early in
the night okay yeah it's kind of it's
it's it's a thing that I you like
to I sa there's also like the peep shows
where like you go that was great and
that was totally not awkward just
standing in a really hot box with you
watching just feeding a coin and then
it's like a like it's the the size of
Max's Corner was the size of the and
there was like a circle and there's a
stage in the middle and you just see
people having sex but for us it was just
a girl in the middle just fingering
herself and then we're like wow yeah no
it was kind of it's just kind of like
how does this exist on Earth but but but
people are so normaliz it's so
normalized over there and people are so
used to it it's just like oh why wanted
why is why is it illegal here like what
changed you know what I mean you don't
know any like history about that I mean
we hardly have a Workers Union in
general those girls got they have a
union for yeah true that's true they're
Union I don't know because it's it would
probably go to hell really fast here in
America I mean America first off if you
think about it like it couldn't be in a
huge City like Los Angeles it would
benefit a lot but it would just be like
taken advantage of yeah it would just be
I mean I
mean I don't really know a great
reliable place in America unless you put
it in the middle of like Iowa mhm where
no one goes but it's just like a bunch
of white horny dudes who have nothing
better to do with their
time and but it's like here it's like
people would break in people would you
know yeah try
and I don't know what I can and can't
say right now but say it all dude yeah I
mean those girls would be it would be a
horrify mess yeah yeah and it and it's
just like weird in general just to walk
because you do have you been never okay
because it's just like walking through
the street it is really weird to think
and be like well the these girls
literally are on display and they're
just sitting there and they're just
waiting for
you and they probably
see I would say upwards of a hundred
people a night that's crazy you think so
oh wait see like in I don't know about a
100 that's a lot I mean some girl I
would say some girls see probably
get like the ones we wanted yeah they
get there at what time like 7:00 yeah oh
yeah on a Friday they probably I feel
like 100 I feel like probably like 4 or
five you would say four or five i i i
because if some dude's like I'll want
you for an
hour okay cuz there are some people who
just drop bands and then that that
window's closed for the whole night I
didn't actually realize that they could
do that I thought it
was see I was going without 20 minut
blocks and that's it but even 20 to 100
time 20 is two 2,000 so what's 2,000
minutes that's that's a lot that's a lot
of time like more than a
night yeah I could probably pull that
number off though I could I could
probably do that you could okay you
could bag a 100 girls in a night no but
if I was welcome to the first I'm come
clean
challenge come on if there was a line of
like wom that I could just be like okay
okay yeah you I I that's tough though
you think you can get a 100 nuts off
you could come a hundred times you would
be different after that the it would
probably be like a metamorphosis it
would insane trans okay fine but I would
say the top girl gets at
least okay 20 25 dudes M that would
that's like I would say Max like
hardcore Max I feel like she'll like
have her like throw the flag in By like
12 well I'm pretty sure they're like I'm
pretty sure some of them are probably
skilled like they just know you know
what I mean like they know how to get
their stamina but I feel like they get
down there too that's what I'm thinking
like they can't even no I feel I don't
know I I feel like maybe but it might
get Catalyst yeah it's like rock yeah
yeah that's wild that's Nar you just
shove your dick in there bro you bring
it back out it's all white cuz it's all
scraped up and [ __ ] you said this is
going to be a cinematography podcast you
started talking
about no we were going to talk about we
talking about your films and you started
bringing up a stripper bro like I miss
it I miss seeing the angels there were
Angels there
dude what else do we see oh no I don't
know I was everything was a Dream from
that point I
mean just like I feel like there's one
thing we missed had you been there
before I've been to Amsterdam twice only
for work and it's been through just
passing through just doing really doing
a show with my dad or something like
that with his crew set up MH you know
set up a stage do the show break it down
leave okay and it's been like damn night
or not yeah yeah actually there's weeds
legal over there too right yeah bars and
stuff mushrooms it was mushrooms to
that's crazy we
never to be what I think mushrooms are
about to be legalized over here oh
really yeah like I feel I feel like
they've been talking about that because
they've been doing a lot of studies and
just like like it's it's benefits for
like mental health just like depression
and [ __ ] but I feel they've been saying
that for years so we'll see what like
actually comes of it yeah but
I do feel like there are I mean in [ __ ]
have I been around like the that game
for a little bit I mean not mushrooms in
particular
like there's some probably some stories
that I'm get to mixed up with not
telling you and having told you tell let
them know about the 10 tabs of acid oh
yeah yeah in treatment right took 10
tabs I didn't mean to but I did yeah I
think you just said you just said it
happen you didn't tell me exactly I'm
not going to say a name and I'm not but
can you tell the story though I can't
tell I want to hear the story with a
name just said
that
so the actually the treatment that I so
I went to
in in treatment and I'm I'm just going
to jump right there but I went through a
series of places about six locations
what age 17 through 19 okay so speedrun
it was just no that was a slow run most
people get out the reason I stayed in so
long and I will I believe this 100% and
it was not to me it was just due to
money it was people telling there was
this one lady who kept me in there the
whole time she was my case manager and
she was just this person who kept money
off you well yeah she just kept uh
telling there was a transitional period
at the end of each uh place whether that
be a Wilderness Program whether that be
a residential whether that be a boarding
school type thing because I also had to
finish school
um she it was just her advice was to go
to the next place that they would they
would always recommend MH and she would
push that recommendation just a little
bit further and it would it would be
enough for my parents to you know float
me on through yeah and uh I went through
place after place after place after
place and up
until uh mid
2020 I went to this one in kenoga park
where I met my friend Emma which is
where we filmed all these movies and and
tried a bunch of [ __ ] and just like
tried figuring that out um I had a
roommate and one night it was just a
[ __ ] ton of
acid
and uh I drank like a I drank like a
full water bottle full of T tabs and it
was did you know they had T tabs it was
not really really up until like the
point it was too late yeah
mhm so that was a crazy night and that
was really [ __ ] scary acid last I
mean acid lasts pretty short for me if
it's a lot um and it was only like four
hours of really tripping but it was like
I saw God yeah I I I couldn't not but
it's like eyeballs on strings was it
like a you no no no it was horrifying
like I instantly threw up um cuz it like
it in general ASD makes you nauseous
yeah and 10 tabs 10 timeses the
nauseousness of just like okay we're
going in really deep as soon as I threw
up into the toilet it was
probably 2 minutes after taking all of
it damn uh how long how long were you
sipping on the water B
for that was like a fast chug damn that
was like a that was like a I'm out of
breath like I'm like
pushups needed sip fast chug d That's
crazy
um so who the [ __ ] put 10 tap was it to
share with a bunch of people like why
was there 10 tabs of acid in there I
don't I don't know I don't know to this
day it's very scary to me to think that
I was around so many drugs yeah uh and
this is in treatment right this is in
treatment and there's staff sitting in
your treatment too so it's like it's
even scarier when there's staff in your
treatment and you're cuz like if your
mom catches you on if your mom catches
you on 10 types of acid then yikes
that's not really a fun time anyways but
when people can like do something about
it and they couldn't be like well you're
an adult we're going to kick you out on
the street yeah cuz you un knowingly are
now seeing God yeah it's like [ __ ] I
don't know what to do with myself so I
just locked myself in the bathroom took
off all my clothes uh facetimed this
friend of mine Emma she's just like this
good friend who freaked me out even more
cuz she's just just not like a good
person to night nightm yeah basically
well no um but it was just like I just
sat pretty much naked in my underwear um
like so so yeah almost fully naked just
sitting there and hanging out on acid
tripping balls and seeing God and it was
just like this void coming at me that's
crazy it was a lot it was a lot of fun
and then what happened afterwards like
what kind of like what what did anything
awaken in you after no absolutely
nothing I played Red Dead Redemption on
my laptop and you weren't shaking or
anything like you just kind of got over
I so scared I thought I was going to go
insane I sorry
I there weren't like lasting effects of
it or anything though like I used to get
um like the
um what do you what's that ride that the
fair like not the the pin wheel I used
to get pin Wheels When I close my eyes D
okay so you just kind of like yeah and
that used and I brought that up to
someone actually I brought it up to
someone in the treatment and she said
that that represents time so for me
that's some weird representation that
like some acid flashback that was coming
back but well it probably has to do with
your dad's award-winning song time from
the movie we'll put that in right here
can you so can you cut this
entire I think I think just for you cuz
that was that was horrible you just said
that to
be I'm sorry I'm sorry if I if I
triggered I'm sorry no but
ask any back to the
drug right shut up shut up wait cuz I
remember you told me when we were out
you were looking at the floor and you
said right now the floor is still moving
if I if I like currently I mean your
lighting setup is really good in here
but if it was it's like high contrast
things like this uh like your floor or
something if I stare long enough at it I
have stickers in my room for instance
they'll um they they'll kind of pulsate
a little bit and the shadows will I know
like sort of fall into themselves and
that'll just happen randomly it doesn't
I'm like you know sober as a gopher but
it just it just happens damn and that's
just kind of the effects of it yeah I
mean yeah because I heard some there was
a story where some guy like said I like
fried something in his brain you can
like that's enough I mean probably half
of that for some people can make you go
insane literally just per fried so the
whole time trying to recount my memory
was like holy [ __ ] like that like that
that keeps me up at night just like the
human mind is something that's so scary
to me um did anyone ever like say you
changed after that moment cuz 10 tabs
sounds insane 10 tabs does sound insane
don't think so okay um I mean you're
lucky yeah it's crazy I I mean I don't I
I I I don't know I it's just it's just
it's just I kind of just came out
unfaced and super shocked and super
scared and it's crazy people have sex on
acid or no I had sex on acid nice my
girlfriend
AA um we'll tag her on Instagram right
here we didn't we didn't mean to we
didn't mean to uh we took the acid we
took two tabs each and um we started
having sex we had sex for like six hours
for real was it amazing or was it just
yeah it was good it was just like
at some point it was like wait what are
we what time is
it that's
wild yeah it's cool I I would say it's
it's like but I definitely I just would
not go to back to acid I would never do
it again like a small tab
like it just freaks me out um I've done
micro doing with shrooms a little bit
and that's great like that's fine I can
take that and that just makes me that
like that's more just like going to
chill have my night make some
food you go to bed yeah it's it's it's
and and I and I and and that that's
something I got into really recently and
and I I just had a DP friend Kira uh
hooked me with some we did a shoot
together you know did a did a good week
of filming out in the
um God damn what do you call it
um Joshua Tree okay and you know it was
kind of time place in space m
yeah so get that but that was you know
it's like i' I I used to I mean in
treatment I used to know a lot of
tweakers like there was this guy Michael
who was uh really into steroids and
Michael Michael ordered a huge package
of steroids in treatment that's crazy
that they're like everyone's still just
doing it like it's
now Idiot the treatment isn't
necessarily for drugs though is so I
went away to treatment mhm for
depression and [ __ ] and it was more like
Mom Dad please just give me a therapist
but fine whatever I went to wait for and
you get drug therapy in it's not like
you can pick and choose it's like MH you
get that because you have to yeah um so
you see a bunch of these peaceful and
these personalities are
so um it's just it's just crazy it's
just it's just it just makes you feel
like you're living in on like the set of
12 Monkeys or something like that um
because a lot of that is is based on
some truth of how people act yeah this
guy Michael was like a roid ra roid
addict sorry every time I pause I'm
thinking if I break Hippa
confidentiality well I think you're
saying first name that's what yeah yeah
I think I don't want to be quoted on
that but I think I'm pretty sure that's
because I I came into this thinking that
if I do bring this up I should just use
first names yeah even just just rename
them too I don't think it matters like
yeah well that who knows yeah yeah I
think but anyway so so so this guy this
guy this guy Mike um he was he brought
this he had just a box of sterile
needles and he opened them up because
they make you open your packages in
front of the full staff and they just
come pouring out and he got so
embarrassed that it made him mad and he
flipped a chair and like threw it into
it he like threw it in the wall and it
like did that weird thing where like it
sticks into the wall and it flops around
you a Hulk dude yeah that sh was crazy I
mean I had a roommate Travis who for
some reason thought I could get DMT I've
never even seen DMT I've like I I don't
even you know I thought I could get he
was heavily schizophrenic like heavily
schizophrenic um he tried to have us
said help him set up his
PlayStation um in like the dorm room and
he couldn't figure it out he couldn't
figure he tried to plug the HDMI cable
in from the PlayStation into the
television but he didn't plug it he just
sort of rested it on top of the TV and
got really freaked out that it wasn't
working and he thought he had like
broken something internally and then he
unplugged it from the place I don't know
I act I genuinely just didn't realize
how this guy couldn't figure it out so
when we tried to he got freaked out
slammed the door he lived in my room so
he like locked himself in our room and
then he went to the bathroom shaved his
head came out with like a little bit of
hair and it was like this little hair
yamaka that he left on top it was just
like a little bit of fuzz that he had
right on top of his head and it was it
was really [ __ ] funny and it was but
it was also really scary CU he would
just like stare you down stare right
through his eyebrows and it was really
freaky you guys had access to like
razors and stuff or like
Clippers like a full lockdown kind of
thing no you I went through like five of
these programs and this was this program
that this lady this treatment therapist
lady had recommended and went hey suzan
and Hans uh your son should go here
finally because we think he's going to
be a human and we think we we can adapt
him into a society finally and treat him
like a real boy so wa so how bad was
your depression like not bad I mean I I
I mean it was te it was Teenage in and
pro I mean I
like I was suicidal but I wasn't like a
I wasn't like a trauma to be around I
was I wasn't like some horrible
outlandish person that I mean this is
all my self perception but I've also
verified it with other people who were
around me at the time it just
like I was also the only one who voiced
it out of the three children who lived
yeah with my because my half sister
lives up in England so she doesn't count
so it's more like I
uh for me it was just kind of the scary
personality of just like oh [ __ ] our son
is six 15 16 17 saying he's depressed
you know um he's just not really he's
isolating a lot he was just staying in
his room playing video games okay let's
send them away it's just like this is
because my mom already sent me to
boarding school when I was 15 I came
back from boarding school for High
School uh for public school in Malibu
high but didn't get to finish that year
off because I got sent away so it's just
like I guess it made sense I could have
I honestly could see it coming looking
like hindsight is 2020 sure
but um it makes sense like it was like
yeah of course my parents were going to
send me away they already did once MH
yeah wait so the first time for boarding
school that was also because of
depression no that was just because my
parents wanted me to go and find a
different experience outside of school
that was something of
like getting out of the public education
system yeah which was you
know it was just I I I just felt like I
was being sent away yeah was the only
one you know so just play that black
sheep narrative do you like do you feel
that now like Black Sheep narrative no
because I'm my own person yeah I my and
and and and a lot of that I don't know
if that was due to treatment and growing
up in 10 tabs of acid and schizophrenic
roommates but it could just still be a
natural maturation process you know it's
like I don't know I will never get that
time back but I can't I don't regret it
you it was like the wor Journey right it
was the worst experience of my life and
I honestly you know it's like so far and
I don't really have like a I don't have
a regret towards it I don't have a love
towards it but I just feel like okay
fine this is life that's yeah go on I
make my own money I do my own [ __ ] I'm
starting you know my own
career it honestly has started to feel
like a bad dream yeah so that's cool was
there ever like a Moment of clarity
though when you were in treatment like
okay I kind of figured why I'm here and
I think I'm good to leave or was it a
lot of the time just it was I I don't
think I ever got to that moment okay
because um the whole time it was just
like the vocabulary around it and the
and the way that they spoke about
treatment was just so like you have to
buy into the program you have to buy
into the program
you you have to be here and the kids
that were there also spoke like
therapist they would therapize you and
they would these like weird many
therapists who would walk around and
tell you to bind the program and they
would tell you to be you know you oh man
you just have to think this way and it
was it literally felt like brainwashing
for a lot of these programs and because
I was physically gooned to Wilderness I
was I was kidnapped to Wilderness when I
was 17 it was just like that was my
first that was the introduction the
transition into treatment and that was
the marker for like your life is now
going to be completely [ __ ] different
and you are going to have absolutely no
control so here you go did that [ __ ] you
up though or like do you think you just
kind of Rod the wave of it is no I I it
[ __ ] me up I was defiant the entire
time I didn't I didn't allow myself I
have a lot of tools from it yeah because
I did get to go to a great place which
was this place called mlan hospital it
was in Massachusetts it was this like
Harvard doctor affiliate school and it
was really something actually
spectacular and I went there that was
probably the fourth place I
went and it was great but they at that
point were like well you're out of
you're actually out of society for a
year and a half you've been
institutionalized and that is the truth
we do need to send you to another place
and I really did trust them and they
were pretty right they showed me a lot
of cool [ __ ] with like how my mind
operates they I understood a lot from
them and they were the first people out
of a year and a half to finally tell me
dude you're just 17 or you're 18 you're
just like a normal [ __ ] person yeah
Tam who was just depressed and that's
looking
infuriating it's kind of just scary it's
really scared me from the word help help
is such a scary word to me and so I
started I I mean I wrote I've written
about 120 page screenplay of just
treatment yeah and just like trying to
turn that into something cuz I think
it's something that's so it's a very uh
first world problem but it's also
something that's so scary to a lot of
people it's like and it's understandable
I get it
now I got [ __ ] up through it yeah um
and it just builds a lot of distrust and
a lot of disentanglement of your own
self it just makes you feel like you
don't know yourself because everyone's
telling you that you don't yeah and then
you're like wait what the [ __ ] I'm 18 MH
what do you think is I should even have
this like like let's say for somebody
that's kind of like going through you're
probably like it's probably like not
like a definitive answer but like what
do you think is like a better approach
to doing like something like that
obviously I'm I'm assuming for you like
cuz you were young like you didn't
necessarily need it let's say somebody
that is like actively battling some very
deep depression like battling like some
psychological issues like what would you
like how would you combat that if you
the tools you I don't think treatment is
a horrible thing to send someone to I
think just it's the way that it I think
it was the
I think it was that they cut my mom out
of the conversation after like 10 months
of being in the pstem my mom had like no
communication and they were just
bullshitting my dad I think it was the
fact that I got sent to this place this
Rehab on um San vente that was the last
PL this rehab in San Vicente I got
kicked out of kogo place Park sent to
the place sent that was the last place I
went to and it was just like oh the BL
who was following me through treatment
uh who was getting a commission off each
place I went to that's crazy when I got
kicked out of Koga park it was like oh
[ __ ]
um I have this great place Max can go to
well she not only co-owned it she
founded the [ __ ] place so it was
like no idea what's going on there it w
you know and it and did your family like
come to like a conclusion realizing like
I told my mom I went Mom this is [ __ ]
up I'm
19 I like I'm trying to start a career
in in in photojournalism or filmography
or some [ __ ] like I mean I'm trying to
like be a human
being and this is what I've been like
for for years I was trying to tell my
parents they're just they're just
getting they're just trying to get money
out of you they're just trying to get
money out of you they're just they're
honestly ruining me at some point I was
told I was I was BPD I was bipolar I was
SK frenic I was bordering uh like acute
paranoia it was all untrue it but it was
just like all these I
mean they [ __ ] me up it it and and so
if you put yourself through the right
place and people I
mean it seemed as if honestly the like
the the the General State psych wordss
because at least those aren't trying to
get money off you you know it's you're
there for for for for a little bit to
just just for a reset yeah it's it's but
no there are places that I do want to
believe
actually you know bring you that
entitlement of you're getting help and
you're and you're and you're and and and
you're actually getting Clarity and yeah
you know but um this really I mean it's
just elucid it how much people can be so
money hungry and just just just so izing
of everything and when I got out of
treatment when I was 19 it was October
17th
2021 and I got out of treatment when I
was 19 and my dad like showed me a bill
for every and I'm not going to say how
much but it you
know and it was just like I expect you
to pay and how yeah not not not in a
million lifetimes yeah you guys did that
to me like you guys you know what I mean
yeah but it but it was also like
that's insane I I the the amount that it
cost for them to send me through two
years of this
[ __ ] it was horrible and I fought I mean
I fought it the whole way through yeah I
have still really great friends about
this and I have a few people that I've
kept up who work there who I'm trying to
get so that I can build sort of this
portfolio against treatment yeah uh
because it's it it really does it does
mess you up yeah where you at now like
mentally
I love life I think life is something
that I'm it's it's it's for me I have a
lot of like these really I mean this is
an this is a really wonderful experience
to be part of just just filling my
circle with with with these positive
times of of just like trying to be a
human being and looking at sex shows and
I mean seriously it's it's a lot of fun
it's a lot of fun just like I'm learning
about and with the people that I want to
do work with and I'm and I'm and I'm
it's really fluid at the moment my
mental state is really good I'm really
just enjoying who I'm becoming I I I I
think yeah I'm just I it's it's I I I I
think I don't need to OV explain it's
just a simple statement of like I'm
proud of myself it's beautiful yeah and
uh but I at the same time do I always
think yeah I probably could have gotten
here without all that yeah we'll never
know yeah but but you know it's like
it's cool I I'm enjoying my work I'm
enjoying the people I'm
meeting uh I'm transitioning out of my
the studio with my dad you know I'm
going to leave his Studio work behind
and because work has gotten pretty
consistent and fluid enough and it's
just like yeah I can actually go out and
get a beer and things like that and set
aside time for myself and like go take
my camera out and drive up like Deer
Creek in Malibu or
you know and and and and take nice
photos and videos and [ __ ] and just do
that like I meditate and it's become one
of the most important things for me and
it's really just something that I I I
try every day I don't I'm not good at
always holding myself accountable to it
but it's just obser it's little things
of observing your mind yeah uh breaking
patterns and noticing them just being
aware of things and then moving on with
your life you know and for me it's just
it's just little things like that yeah
like I after treatment I took just on my
own a solid year and a half of sobriety
from everything well I mean that in the
sub no I no I jerked it like crazy
that's all I
have but I just evaluated how things
felt for me and just just just what I
wanted to do with myself because I was
still doing video production stuff I was
still doing smaller films with friends
and getting you know the experience of
that and some were paid some were not
some paid someone you know it's fine
it's not you know I was still just
living with my family it's I didn't need
to make money but it's just
like figuring that out and then being
actually and then realizing that like
holy [ __ ] I I kind of know what I'm
doing and it felt good to feel relied on
by people and being like I I something I
appreciate for my dad is he knows how to
build a really good crew it's the
camaraderie it means everything Aldis
was telling us one night in Amsterdam of
like oh man I don't know how we're not
just sitting here so awkwardly and like
super upset at each other I've never
expected any night to be like that
because it's I've never had a bad moment
on I have I've had I've I screamed at
this guy that I needed to bring on set
he wasn't a first ad or anything he just
volunteered um but I thought he could
understand what like a SE stand was and
we were in the middle of barow and it
was 120° heat and we were both dying and
he was fumbling over trying to take the
[ __ ] tripod plate off the camera and
the screw was stuck and he needed one of
the screw coins he sweating and Drench
and drenched and sweat and just panting
and I just go like sit the [ __ ] in the
car so I screamed at him so yes I have
had a bad moment but I dude huh you went
Whiplash I did go Whiplash a little bit
I almost threw the [ __ ] can Affinity
at his head um but I try not to end like
and that was the worst time I've ever
had on a set and but it's just for me
like i' I've stepped on the people's
toes in my dad's Productions I've
stepped on toes in Productions that I've
been the DP on or the first AC or just
like doing all the like because for a
lot of them I do all the work I'm the
gaffer I'm the grip I'm the first AC and
the
dit and so it's like um just trying to
bring
realize that like no matter the crew or
the budget or whatever it's the same job
yeah um and I you know you buy him a
beer at the end of the night yeah you
know you it's the experience that
matters like right and then you're fine
the next morning it's like you go up you
get up and go to work and if you can be
friends at the end of it yeah and you
know if you can hold these relationships
it's like we're all at the start of our
careers yeah and that's something that I
keep hearing a lot and something that's
very true it's like it's this will be
something really memorable to realize in
5 10 20 years and so I appreciate that
reminds me of uh Being Mary Kate that's
Mary
Kate so as you know I haven't done this
in a while this feels weird it's been a
very you look different in this lighting

and driving around in bing School
Massachusetts and um we were going to
get first off I got my phone stol by a
homeless lady who sat on it and put the
phone in her vagina at the train station
what did you try to get it back how it
smell after no I didn't try and get it
back for you I was so stoned at the
train station that I we saw the cops and
we didn't think about asking them cuz
they thought we thought they were going
to arrest us for being stoned in
Massachusetts yeah um but but we got we
got a really horrible car accident
because our because the car slipped off
the road it was like it was like mid
November or something [ __ ] like that and
we got in this car accident and we flew
into a snow
bank and um yeah we called the cops and
they came to pick us up and our friend's
mom picked us up and she called all of
our moms and my mom came and it was
super embarrassing and did they know you
guys were
faded yeah and I uh and my mom brought
me to the school and the school thought
about giving me a suspension but they
were like no this is [ __ ] weird you
know what I have a much better
story when I was 15 I lost my virginity
to at boarding school in the back of the
woods behind school behind the dumpster
and we got caught by my school by my
math teacher
Mr who caught us and well he didn't
actually we hid behind the dumpster and
I don't think he actually saw us but he
took my wallet and my and my phone and
[ __ ] and like walked into the Dean's
office and then we went to the dean and
apparently he at that point we didn't
know but he did see us and then I got
like a three-day suspension for having
sex with and uh well a great girl I love
but she's
not
she's not she's not she's not she's not
someone that I
um I I proudly I proudly shared
my uh juices but I don't know how to
finish this off well I came in the
condom but I was just like how do I say
this great friend of mine but i' I I'm
not sexually attracted to her in any way
sh or for even back then even back then
wow she was she was she was a um she was
a heavier girl back then and it was not
a high five situation did everybody find
out after everyone found out everyone
make fun of you everyone made fun of us
and it was
um yeah it's kind of boring now that I
talk about it no that's actually that's
real it was awward with the rest of it
was really awward well no it was just
behind the school do you talk to her at
all yeah talk all the time for real yeah
we're great friends that's awesome I
don't talk to M though he's kind of yeah
it was the rest of the semester was a
little did you wait till was kind of
brutal yeah no he's he actually put on
binoculars and stared right through the
trees he uh yeah took a good long peep
right at us yeah wow wait oh but did did
you finish did you did you not did you
finish though like you finished once I
mean the losing your virginity I don't
know if you remember this but it
probably it lasted all 15 seconds yeah
so it's like you know but that was 15
seconds too long because we got caught
right then
damn well at least you got to put on a
show you're a trooper now Jared has to
come clean
oh oh we're doing a roundie um I got one
of like getting caught we weren't
necessarily doing anything too bad I
might have talked about this on here I I
like hit like a hookah pan at school and
this is crazy I forgot about those those
were cool yeah those were crazy but this
story kind of came full circle for me
within like the last year cuz I'll get
to that point so I hit this hookah pen
and I go and I blow it at my friends
like they're like standing in some
corner and I'm just like I blow it at
them and like we're like laughing like h
next you I have I have somebody put a
hand on my shoulder and I turn around
I'm like what's up and it's a [ __ ]
teacher and he's like give it to me and
I'm like give you
what and he hits it I'm like give you
what
bro but pretty much I think like I I I
wasn't even holding it my friend was
holding it so I hit it off like in his
hand so I didn't even have it on me so I
just I just denied it the whole time and
he ends up walking away and it was a
like every time I saw that dude at
school it was it was like I was scared
it like filled me with anxiety you
didn't give him like a Big Smoke like uh
inhaled
like a bun of like that would have been
I would have been [ __ ] at that point
like CU at least like he didn't see it
like like I feel like I was it was
plausible deniability since I was facing
the other way it could have been
somebody else you know what I mean oh
yeah yeah oh yeah that's yeah but but
then I ended up seeing this dude like at
at the at a bar like within the last
year like the teacher and I just like I
didn't tell him but like I just chopped
it up with him and I don't think he
recognized me but it was just like nice
to like talk to him I was like I think I
told him I was you went to SAR right and
he's like yeah and I was like I went
there too and everything it was just
like like it was like peace in me for
the first time in my life cool it was
crazy got that closure finally exactly
like I was like he doesn't hate me yeah
it was this moment of of like shared
Enlightenment you you both felt safe
exctly probably probably could have like
w i could huged him blanket and swaddled
him a little bit we were drinking I
probably could have bought him a drink
who knows what that would have led to
that would have been a would have been
crazy a good night
though I was he has something this feels
like we're sitting by the campfire it is
oh that's actually stories oh we should
done the flame effect that's so
true that's crazy you are a
DP that's
crazy
who you mean
it I think all this has a story if he's
comfortable talking about it I think you
should teach something different what
what do you guys thinking about nothing
oh oh no I have nothing but I have this
one
teacher I remember like in like I think
this was like eighth grade I remember I
was like hugging a girl and then we were
just feeling each other up and I was
just grabbing butt and she was grabbing
butt and then like I was grabbing her
butt she was grabbing butt yeah we were
all both grabbing butt hugging just
grabbing butt and then a teacher like my
history teacher who I te for Mr
copenhaver walked by and he just saw and
I was and then I
just and then he walked by smacked her
ass too no he didn't do that be [ __ ]
all this no but then for the whole time
I was like searching up I was like can I
get in trouble for consen grabbing butt
I'm in E grade there's no Yahoo ansers
thing but yeah and then that happened
and then for like the whole year I was
Tang for him and I just looked down I
was like please don't come up to me and
talk to me about grabbing butt you know
like cuz I don't know so I'll just grab
him butt today
AR I'm sorry you're a 31y old
man like count it but yeah
13 he's like I've been dying to do that
all year all

sure going to H yeah Witnesses he saw

foreign
another year and you know we were kind
of saying it goes quickly I mean does it
feel like you were just at Christmas and
all of a sudden the season's over did it
go quick for you yeah yeah I think this
season felt very quick okay it feels
like it's February still or like it's
playoff hasn't even started but it's
it's over for us so it's kind of crazy
how fast the season wins I I feel like
uh you know I was talking a couple guys
about this but for you especially you
haven't had a normal season there's
always been covid something different
season gets extended I mean what was it
like to go through basically a normal
year at this point I think it felt good
like kind of like a little back to the
basics because like you said the last
two years been a little different so
it's actually very nice that it's like
full Full House uh when we play and just
like everything's uh as it was before
Corbin happened so that's nice if you go
back and think to the beginning of the
year what you're you're trying to do I
mean were you able to accomplish some of
your goals I mean for you individually
how do you kind of put this season in
perspective
I think you guys have a pretty good
season for me I just try to play as good
as I could and I think I played pretty
decently so it was pretty good season
when uh last year obviously you know you
were got to be up up at the end of the
year but you didn't get a chance to play
in the playoffs and this time you got
got a big roll but it was only two games
I mean what was the playoff experience
like for you obviously you guys as a
team played pretty well it just didn't
shake your way but I think playoffs is
so fun I think that's what you play it
for you kind of go through regular
season can be kind of like a long
Highway you just wait until you get to
the playoffs so I just had so much fun
it was unfortunately it was very short
but it was it was fun to be back playing
playoffs
this team and and I know especially with
you guys in the back end I mean it was a
pretty tight group of of guys uh what
are you gonna remember from from this
group uh being together and being pretty
tight just all the smiles I think we
have like we've been a lot of guys like
getting called up and you guys coming in
everything but everyone has been awesome
so it's been a really really fun group
to hang around with every day so just
all the everyday
hanging and laughing all those stuff so
for the summer I'm assuming you're gonna
go back to Sweden what what do you like
to do in the summer what are your uh
Summers usually like do you like to hang
with the friends and family it's a lot
of places you haven't seen in a while
that's nice to see
and then play some paddle pennies to
like to do that maybe a little bit of
soccer
for gym time for guys that want to play
and then just working out and enjoying
sometimes good weather in Sweden yeah I
was gonna say I mean obviously it's
better but I mean how does it get warmer
there it's still probably not in La no
it's not like you can have some really
good days but sometimes it's very
disappointing that it's summer and it's
raining so it's not the best weather
it's not like LA weather but it's
you really enjoy when it's good weather
in Sweden I'm pretty sure you know this
is a little bit different I mean the
past couple years you've known you're
coming back this past year you're able
to sign a couple couple year deals so
um you know knowing that hey you don't
have to go for a new contract does that
help kind of get your mind ready and
know that you're going to be back here
again next year yeah I think so I think
it always can be a little uncertainty so
when you like you leave you don't have a
contract when you live and you think
you're going to be back but then maybe
longer and you start thinking so that's
it's nice to know that they I know I
have a contract and
it's a little nice you've been here for
a while now how comfortable are you with
the King's organization the rain and
everybody who's around here pretty
comfortable I feel like I know everyone
I'm pretty good Pace it's like a
thing here for a while and a lot of
people that play in that work here has
been here for a long so I'm pretty
comfortable
any goals for for the summer any goals
for for next year I mean obviously the
certain one is you want to be with the
Kings yeah exactly yeah that that is my
goal and what I really is kind of focus
on this hour to accomplish

Nathan Noel,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ2ziRyIXOw,"you spent time up here in Rockford time
down at Indy kind of give me your take
on the season as a whole how do you feel
it went for you personally in what was
it like um being in the lock us I mean
being in the locker room was great here
it's a great group of guys and that's
why they went so far I mean you can't
you can't win without having a
tight-knit group so but being up and
down I mean it was a great experience
you learn a lot from being down there
and you don't really get that if you
never go down so so I mean first year I
I can take a lot out of this and I'll
bring a lot of experience and to next
year just because I got this year under
my belt so are some of the things you
were able to work on and with the fuel
that you weren't able to kind of work on
here at the I saw so it's kind of like a
stacked raster that they had so what are
some opportunities or scenarios you're
able to kind of I mean hockey's hockey
so it was like I just when I went down I
think the main thing is to keep working
on your game and not get not be a bad
bad guy cuz you go down there you just
you just pack your bags go and get to
work and that's what I did and I like
met a lot of good guys down there and we
had a good group we made a good playoff
run so it's good I was I was happy with
it and learned a lot and I got to get to
play a lot more down there so you get to
work on your skills and have the puck a
bit more so it was good
so leaving your meetings today what are
some of the things I told you kind of
work on to make your stay in Rockford
more permanent and potentially going up
to the big club in Chicago for me it's
all consistency it's just you got to
bring it every single night and some
nights it's tough to do that but that's
pro hockey just how to find a way and so
for me that's the biggest thing and this
summer I obviously gonna go to work as
hard as I can and
and come back and try to turn heads so
with the thing is shortened somewhere
you're gonna take some time off go on
vacation or anything are you gonna kind
of pop right back into training I'll
take the rest of this week and next week
off and then I'll get back at it and I'm
I'm pretty fresh anyways because because
I wasn't playing for the last while as
black ace and with the team so so I'll
be ready to go so how was it how did you
take your role as being a black ace of
the team you didn't get any playing time
in the postseason but what was the
mentality like you can be called up at
any time you just got to stay ready
you're gonna stay ready and you got to
be a good guy in the locker room you got
to stay positive and you know just going
to try to keep working on your game and
if you don't play you still gotta try to
get better and look at the big picture"

Rhett Gardner,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsP1YLLTawI,"hi i'm rick gardner i played at und from
2015 to 2019.
in my four years at und i was fortunate
enough to play in two destination games
first being my sophomore year i went
over boston college
at madison square garden in new york
city and the second
my senior year went over minnesota in
vegas i think that the two biggest
things that stood out for me with those
games was
first off the the frozen four feel to
them
obviously my freshman year in tampa
getting to see the fans and the hype
and kind of the support and the week
leading up to it was super cool and it
felt the exact same going to new york
and
even more so going to vegas and i think
just the second thing is just feeds off
that is the fact that
our fans just traveled so well and uh
you know in new york
times square was all green and in vegas
the strip was all green as well so
i'm really excited to watch the boys
this year uh you know chase another
championship and
also see broadway street all green you
know
have fun in nashville boys and i'm
excited to be watching you"

here with Casey's Tom and it is a
difficult stretch right now for sure but
this weekend you look at a new star
perhaps where does it need to start for
the start to begin I think just this we
can practice on us is where it begins
like all the fans to the work that we do
on Friday and Saturday night but like
that's not ultimately the end of the day
where we get better we get better during
the week Monday through Thursday with
the work that we put in we trust our
process we trust with coach has us do so
we just kind of got to get back to
square one and keep working hard in
practice and figure things out that way
this week in Omaha Cedar Rapids both
home games both big crowds expected here
this weekend how do you know how will
you feed off of that energy knowing that
it's going to be pretty bigger this
weekend I think the guys are going to
love it it's going to be huge for us you
know especially with the fans been the
one supporting us when we're down you
know they could be inclined to say like
I'm going to stay home tonight I'm not
going to come out to the game but like
but their support really we really
appreciate them being behind us through
a tough stretch like this so we're going
to Cologne definitely play hard for them
do you feel the things are changing here
in terms of the the play style the
toughness of games knowing that it is
the stretch run here and playoffs or
basically less than 20 games away here
yeah absolutely i mean the fans can see
it too and we feel it out there on the
ice it's two playoff atmosphere with
teams battle for points and it's so
tight right now in our conference were
one point away from being in fourth
place behind Youngstown of a ski and so
we got to keep Allen every night but you
can feel the intensity ramped up like
games are faster plays are harder guys
are coming out to compete because the
end of the day and over jockeying for
position in the playoff round we want to
position myself as well as we can"

bloomington thunder in the 2014-15
inaugural year but we do have one final
player of the month sponsored by hupey
and abraham and it's the guy to my left
it's mitchell matson forward for your
bloomington thunder matson appreciate
the time and uh and obviously coming
into this first year for you and little
time that you've had here in bloomington
what's been your overall uh thought of
how you played and the organization as a
whole yeah it's been great obviously the
hockey is a lot different than what i'm
used to um but uh the training and stuff
like that has been has been good and
it's it's opened my eyes to a lot of
things and uh you know it's been overall
a great experience as as far as the jump
is concerned we've talked to a lot of
guys about the differences between
different junior leagues from high
school now to the ushl how tough has it
been for you totally different the guys
are much stronger on their sticks skates
obviously it's a lot faster and the only
systems are a lot more strict so uh it's
just kind of a tighter game overall just
a lot faster and overall just being the
first overall pick for the bloomington
thunder in the first draft obviously
coming back next year is is one of the
things in your mind as a possibility for
for going to the future what's the
outlook look like for you in the ushl
and also with the thunder yeah for sure
i mean it was good to to have that honor
of getting drafted first and uh you know
i just hope to keep improving and do
anything i can to help the team and get
bigger and faster stronger over the
summer how was it to get that first ushl
goal yeah it's it's kind of a big weight
lifted off your shoulder uh yeah it's
it's always good to get that first goal
out of the way well mitch i appreciate
the time we're looking forward to a lot
more here in the the next season as we
move on into the off season uh best of
luck in the last game thanks for having
me that's mitchell matson your hoopie
and abraham player of the month"

Colton Point,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMbgglMo9_k,"first gaming about the you know
this weekend really in about three weeks
now you get back-to-back starts
uh how did it feel out there or at least
back-to-back games anyway
it felt good you know uh obviously last
night you know you never want to go in
for the other guy
but uh you know it definitely helped
getting a little bit before today
yeah um but no i felt i felt good up
there i was seeing the puck well
um you know the guys kept most of the
shots to the outside which was awesome
makes my job a lot easier uh so yeah i
just you know
finally felt good to get back in the
game and you know just wanted to
keep proving myself how easy is it or
how difficult is it to replicate uh
game conditions in practice um
you know compared you know especially
maybe this year
yeah i mean try as you want like
they'll never be exactly the same you
know obviously i go out and practice
and and try battle as hard as i can
every day and
you know that's what the coaches want to
see so you can get pretty close
but uh you know like in practice you're
doing clear-cut two-on-ones clear
like back to back-to-back you know that
never happened in the game back to back
like that so
you know we try to do a lot of power
play penalty kill stuff and
that's probably the closest but uh you
know you just gotta
try and stay focused and you know
picture stuff
like it would happen in a game this year
you kind of got really your first
little extended look at this level uh
what are you trying to take away from
this year
uh when all the games after next week
are over you know uh
i just want to be you know proud and
happy with the effort i put in
um you know i i've definitely had some
ups and downs this year struggled a
little bit with consistency but
you know that's all part of it i think
and uh
you know compared to last year and
obviously my first year i definitely
feel like i've made
a lot of strides so uh you know i'm just
trying to keep the ball rolling
hopefully you know
get another contract with dallas i'd
love to stay here
but uh yeah you know just trying to keep
the ball rolling
what do you find the biggest difference
in the jump up from
echl up to this level um
it's a lot more how do i say this
it's more organized almost you know
in the east coast you get you know some
weirder choppier plays
that you know maybe wouldn't happen at
this level and i mean you obviously see
that from this level to the nhl as well
some of those weird bouncy plays sort of
go away so i think it's just that um the
east coast
is a great league in my mind especially
in the last couple years
um you know lots of guys who are good at
hockey
not that many spots so uh good league
yeah i just think uh
just some weird bouncy chippy plays that
uh
don't happen up here thank you
colton if you could kind of sum up uh
this one year and
and what it's been like for you guys in
the locker room
um how would you kind of sum up the
overall season
it's uh it's been weird but
good um you know not being able to
like do stuff away from the rink you
know it's really helped us
bond at the rink you know bond over
hockey
um and i think that's brought us really
close as a team
especially like we can't you can't go
out shopping and stuff like that so
if you want to do something it's got to
be with the guys at the rate
and i think that this is probably one of
the closest teams i've played on
in a couple years and uh
you definitely notice it on the ice i
think uh guys are way more connected and
stuff like that
um on the flip side you know it takes a
toll mentally
and like sometimes you know you're
you're sitting at home and
you got nothing to do and it sucks but
you know
getting to come to the rink at least
like there's places where
you can't do anything like my hometown
in north bay like
my parents are locked down they got
nothing to do so you know i'm i'm happy
that
i can be here playing hockey you know
with some
good friends so"

games at home in particular what's gone
into that yeah I think we uh We've
started really really well like you said

ready to what to expect from the other
team
um but yeah at the same time we we just
gotta make sure we keep it going in a
second like we did tonight
you've gotten some reinforcements in the
lineup with guys like perlini Drury
Suzuki coming back and contributing you
start off 2023 with a nice win at home
what's the confidence level of a locker
room right now it's good I mean like

well lately

consistent but I thought tonight we
stuck to our game and trusted the

from Providence here on Wednesday
morning and I am answering a bunch of
your mailbag questions on today's brand
new episode of Locked on Boston Bruins
you're locked on Bruins your daily
podcast on the Boston Bruins part of the
locked on podcast Network your team
every day
[Music]
thank you
what is up Bruins fans and welcome back
to another episode of Locked on Boston
Bruins this is a Daily Show where we
discuss all things spoke to me
and I want to thank you so much for
making locked on Bruins part of your day
every single day we are free and
available wherever you get podcasts
Bessie would love to say hi she's
jumping on my desk here as I begin
recording uh please do subscribe on your
favorite podcast app as well as on
YouTube We're nearing 1 000 subscribers
and when we do hit that I'm going to be
giving away this commemorative limited
edition
Patrice Bergeron Tim Horton's stick to a
lucky subscriber
if you are on Twitter and Instagram you
can find the podcast at locked NHL
Bruins you can find me my dad jokes and
hockey tweets at ENC McLaren on today's
episode I'm going to answer a bunch of
listener questions that were sent to me
this morning via social media
but first
the Bruins have made a minor move this
morning recalling forward unicopping in
from the Providence Bruins and assigning
Chris Wagner back down to the AHL
Wagner of course had been recalled for
the
trip out to California in light of the
Jake de Brusque injury
uh competent carries a much more modest
750 thousand dollar cap hit whereas
Chris Wagner
went up at the NHL level is at 1.35 so
they're not only saving a bit against
the cap but
they're filling a bit of a need as
Thomas nosik I'm not sure if he's banged
up but he's not been playing fantastic
down on the fourth line
component has played in 34 games for
Providence this season five goals 14
assists
he's also a
solid defensive player who can succeed
in the Face-Off Circle which is
important if he's going to fill in for
no sick for example
uh he's a fifth round selection from the
2016 NHL entry draft and has yet to
appear in a National Hockey League game
his
debut could come as early as tomorrow
night against the Seattle Kraken
so that's the latest when it comes to
the Bruins roster
in advance of tomorrow night's game they
will be gathering for practice here on
Wednesday to get ready for those uh
Kraken who have been
on a pretty long
uh Eastern Conference road trip here and
it's gone pretty well for them we'll
preview this game more fully tomorrow
but uh
they
are pretty much yeah
undefeated here in 2023 they beat the
Islanders to begin 2023 on January 1st
they
embarked on this road trip
beat the Oilers beat the Maple Leafs
beat the Senators
beat the Canadians
last night they beat the Sabers and then
they will be in Boston on Thursday and
then wrap up the ship
Saturday in Chicago
so Seattle pretty hot coming into this
one and again we'll preview that more
fully on tomorrow's show
for now let's get into
some mail-back questions that you all
sent in not all of you sadly but some of
you and there's some really good ones
here that I want to address first of all
let's begin with Bob beers19 who asks
what position if any do you believe the
Bruins should address at the deadline
great question I think you just have to
look at this recall for some
idea there I think the Bruins you know
went healthy their top six is formidable
you have
the benefit of putting a Taylor Hall on
the third line with Charlie Coyle you
might want to add a scoring right winger
on that line Craig Smith just doesn't
seem to have it these days
and you might want to improve your
fourth line Center if nosik remains
somewhat ineffective or is banged up on
defense
the top six when healthy I really love
you have sporal strawman Riley's still
around
if
there's some injuries so perhaps you
could upgrade there as well uh you know
if you can add to the top four
said Jacob chicken or something like
that I'd be all over that he has a very
great contract for the next few years
um
but the biggest area I think would be
kind of a scoring Winger to put on
the third line
and when you think about this latest
recall I would have been okay with Oscar
steam being recalled or perhaps even
Fabian lysel the Bruins are the best
defensive team in the NHL right now
and they can afford to put kind of a
looser defensive forward in the bottom
six in order to kind of just boost the
offense a bit more so that's an area
that I think
um
could be one to look at
Bob ears also asked most underrated
Bruin that's a great question at the
moment I think
um that's tough to say I still think
Matt grizzlik is kind of underrated by
Bruins fans uh
he's not as flashy as Tori Krug used to
be but he is incredibly gifted
defenseman Puck possession guy uh I'd
probably put him as the most underrated
guy for the Bruins at the moment
all right let's uh let's answer one more
before the break kind of a related
question we always talk about big names
but who are some depth guys the Bruins
could acquire at the deadline I've kind
of spoken about this before there's a
few guys
that's
I think could fit that bill
uh you look at
the Bruins killer in game seven last
year
in Max Domi in uh Chicago is not my
favorite player per se but I think he
could be that kind of guy who could add
some
grit as well as some scoring to the
bottom six he's on a three million
dollar deal pending unrestricted free
agent and I think he could fit in well I
like vladislav gabrikov and Columbus
again another physical defenseman who
can choose some minutes and chip in on
the penalty kill those are a couple guys
that pop into mind uh right away also
Anthony declare
would be a great pickup from the Florida
Panthers for that scoring boost in the
bottoms six

let's keep rolling with some of these
questions Mike kamish kamish
hope I'm saying that right
if Patrick Kane wants to force his way
to Boston
ala Taylor Hall and that drives his cost
down for assets
assuming his injury isn't serious he's
been in and out of the Chicago lineup a
little bit lately would you make the
move oh that's a tough one I need a sip
of coffee in order to think about that
for a sec
[Music]
I'm not a Patrick Kane fan personally
and
his numbers have really ripped this
season which I guess is understandable
seeing as
Chicago Blackhawks aren't really built
for Success this season
he's on Pace for 15 goals and 40 to
assists
which would be
his lowest point total in
a decade when he played well in the
lockout shortened season where he had 55
points in 47 games so in a full season
this would be his
lowest output ever
he's also a minus 24 which again Chicago
is pretty bad uh he's on Pace for 280
shots
and his shooting percentage is a career
low 5.3 so that should be
set to rise
if it's another Taylor Hall situation
where you only have to give up
an Anders Bjork type guy and they don't
have any second round picks so it would
have to be uh
a third I'm not giving up a first round
pick in 2023 for Patrick Kane at this
stage in his career
it's very tempting I'm not gonna lie I
don't love him
as
you know based on his office stuff
uh not necessarily the kind of guy that
I want seeing celebrate a cup win with
Patrice Bergeron but if you can get him
for pretty cheap
I don't know I mean you look at the
Bruins top six when healthy and
like I said last week Jacob Rusk is the
kind of player
that you think you're going to get in
Patrick Kane he's a game breaker he has
come up big in big moments this season
and
he's on Pace for greater output than
Patrick King
so I don't know if you disrupt things by
bringing in a presence like Patrick King
again if Don Sweeney's presented with
that Taylor hall-esque
option then he would likely take it
me personally I'm not sure if if that's
the move to make
zest hockey asks how important is it to
acquire
a number one Center to get pasta to
resign
can't see him wanting to spend the next
eight years of his career feeding off
coil with his aspirations
who do we Target and how much are we
willing to give up
I think from Dave apostratic side of
things I I do think that that's a
consideration you have
uncertainty at that position moving
forward with
Patrice Bergeron and David crazy
possibly
being done after this season I'm not
sure if that's likely but it's possible
they're both unrestricted free agents
getting up there if the Bruins do win
the cup per se I could see them
walking away on top although it would be
nice if they came back when they're
still playing at high levels in order to
try to defend that
imposter maximize yeah he wants to know
that he's going to have
a premier player
at Center if he's going to stick around
there's not really much
in the pipeline that way Brett Harrison
seems pretty solid
map Watchers a few years away he's not a
number one Center either
so that's a consideration we can't
ignore that from a Bruins point of
things they're not going to do anything
drastic in order to appease posture
knock
they're not going to make a huge move
just for the sake of adding a center for
the future unless it fits in with their
current plan of winning the Stanley Cup
the number one target would obviously be
bohorvat from Vancouver he's having a
career here he's going to be an
unrestricted free agent and he's the
type of player
that fits the Bruins mold
High Talent but also defensively
responsible
how much are we willing to give up I
don't know if you're willing to give up
first drop pick
or Fabian myself that's probably what
it's going to take to get a number one
Center via trade
do you wait until the off season
try to lure a guy on the first day of
free agency and say look pasta this is
who we brought in
please be more comfortable signing
um that's a bit of a risk because he
will of course also hit free agency at
the same time
so that could be
um
yeah
it's a big risk to not have that Center
locked in long term but
poster neck I would think would
foreign
be comfortable staying where he's at
rather than the unknown of going into
free agency and
um having that uncertainty maybe he
tests the market sees what's out there
comes home
maybe he
resigns
and
puts his faith in Don Sweeney and Cam
Neely that they will bring in a number
one Center if Bergeron and creature
leave
um
but hopefully
the Bruins just get it done and
sign him long term
which leads me to my next question from
Owen at Boston underscore sports86 how
much do you believe it will take to sign
pasta and make him a lifer Now poster
doc has already said that he's not
looking to set any new records when it
comes to average annual valuation that
would be
set by Nathan McKinnon next year at 12.6
I've said for a while that it'll
probably be
eight years 88 million dollars so an 11
million dollar cap hit that should be
enough to keep him in black and gold for
the foreseeable future
a couple more questions coming up after
the break I want to thank you once again
for making locked on Bruins part of your
day again please do subscribe on your
favorite podcast app and on YouTube
we're getting very close to 1 000
subscribers and uh it would mean a lot
to me if you uh jumped on board
a couple more questions here Sam at pars
of all
our eye asks when are we going to see
Mark McLaughlin
great question everybody was impressed
by his uh performance at training camp
this year
for the Providence Bruins this season no
he's not blowing anybody Away really
he's got four goals six assists for 10
points in 34 games
I wouldn't expect we'll see him
this season unless
there are some severe injuries there's a
few guys ahead of him likely to be
recalled
first
you think of us Christine we already
seen unicompanin
Vinnie letieri perhaps bring some
veteran experience you have Georgie
Murphy love Luke toporowski who are
outperforming McLaughlin
uh Fabian myself would be a guy to keep
an eye on as well as a possible recall
once he gets back
well he is back from the world juniors
but you know gets a bit few more games
back under his belt
Auto rocket at Mick Monahans asks what
is the plan for dumping Craig Smith and
Mike Riley salary to make a meaningful
upgrade all right now they are both
aried in the AHL well actually Riley is
not Craig Smith ideally they'd find a
taker for Craig Smith's 3.1 million
dollar cap hit
he had
cleared waivers already can still be
assigned there for a little bit I
believe I not sure if the 30 days is up
worst case they just bury them in
the AHL and uh have a reduced cap it
best case they can find someone to
take them on I don't know if they'd have
to add a sweetener in the form of a
draft pick to get people to take those
on but right now I should just wait and
see and
of course right now Wagner Riley buried
in the AHL Craig Smith remains up with
the team
but that could change
seeing as he's already been placed on
waivers and cleared
finally nationally National goalie hug
Association at goalie hug Association
asked who's the most huggable Bruin
I mean obviously we have a good sample
size knowing that Lena salmark Jeremy
swamin are good Huggers I feel like
Charlie McAvoy
would be a good hugger as well I'm a big
hug Aficionado I love a good hug uh so
I'd be willing to go in the locker room
and test that out should the opportunity
arise
based on personality on off the ice who
would you guess is Monty's favorite
player
I mean
he's not gonna have a favorite player at
least publicly there's a lot of guys in
the room that are very personable uh I
would think
for him it's all about the friends you
make along the way he's happy to be
there happy to be part of this group he
inherited
a fantastic locker room
and the Resurgence of Nick folino
has really helped that
um so you know Bergeron fellino
I'm sure are among the guys that he goes
to
um
for uh helping to set the tone for this
team
thanks so much for sending in those
mailbag questions

Cameron Clarke,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAFx6BP3h4Y,"like Kira this is Leonardo calling just
like the magic books yeah yeah hey
everybody I'm cam Clark I am a voiceover
actor I am a singer avid gardener I'm a
looper I'm a Scorpio I like long walks
on the beach and candlelit dinners wait
I'm sorry that's for someone else
hey it's camp I'm a voice actor some of
the voices that I am best known for
would be first and foremost Leonardo of
the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
hey no problem as well as Rocksteady
well so from the Teenage Mutant richen -
what is that called again he-man Masters
of the Universe as well as Prince Adam
what else what else what else oh yes of
course
one of the favorites liquid snake dear
brothers from Metal Gear Solid I started
my career back in 1964 when my family
had a series on ABC a musical variety
show called the King family my mom was a
famous singer or one of the King sisters
and since they were already established
[Music]
the show kind of was very fortunate next
step I never had a straight job so I
went straight from doing the King family
which went till I finished high school
to spend some time in college and the
voice everything was quite an accident
first voiceover jobs I had were I think
called looping which is putting all the
background vocals in for television and
and movies the fight grunts you know
murders and hospital pages and police
radio calls that's all done by a group
of people in the studio after the film
is shot
[Music]
there are two that were my most favorite
characters and it's not the ones you
might think Freddy from barnyard Hess
was amazing a lot of comics so not just
voice people and they would have us do
this scene from the script and then we
do our second take was say whatever you
want just these are your guidelines so
that was fun but my very favorite role
of all time besides my family because
that's number one was doing Snoopy and
getting to work with Lee Mendelson
because for me my childhood was Charlie
Brown stealing the show my mom wouldn't
know her pop when we won the when it was
announced that we got the Emmy for
barnyard that was an amazing feeling you
know to be recognized as it's a cliche
but to be recognized by your peers and
of course you know the fact that it's
not me on camera it's it's talk about
teamwork I mean on camera people are
always talking you know thanking their
you know their coaches or their makeup
people and the produce and everything
but really it's a team because I'm not
the one that you're seeing I'm just one
cog in the wheel and yet it still was a
pretty terrific terrific moment
